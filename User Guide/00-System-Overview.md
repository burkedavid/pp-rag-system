### Q: How do I work with multiple records at the same time?
**A**: Right-click on any menu option or record link and select "Open in New Tab". This allows you to view multiple records simultaneously while keeping your original screen open.

### Q: What does it mean when I see a green tick icon in the left-hand menu?

**A**: Use standard formats like PDF, GIF, and JPG to ensure all users can view attached files. Be mindful of file sizes, especially for mobile users.
