# End-to-End Regulatory Processes - Your Complete Workflow Guide

## What This Guide Does for You

**Integrated regulatory workflows:** This guide demonstrates how different modules in the Idox Public Protection System work together to handle complete regulatory cases. It shows you how premises records, inspections, complaints, licensing, and enforcement activities connect in real-world scenarios.

**Why this matters:** Regulatory work often involves multiple system modules and activities. Understanding how these connect helps you work more efficiently and ensures nothing falls through the cracks when managing complex cases.
