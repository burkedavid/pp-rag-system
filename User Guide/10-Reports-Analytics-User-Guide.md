- Verify filtering criteria - are you comparing like-with-like?
- Review data definitions - ensure understanding of what's being counted
- Check for timing differences - when data was extracted vs when counted

**Solutions**:
1. **Standardize definitions**: Use system definitions rather than manual interpretations
2. **Sync timing**: Run dashboard and manual counts at same time
3. **Document methodology**: Record exactly how manual counts performed
4. **System training**: Understand how system categorizes and counts data
5. **Regular calibration**: Periodically check manual vs system counts for consistency

### Common Issue 2: "Statutory return figures seem wrong"

**Problem**: Government return data doesn't align with expectations or previous years
**Validation checklist**:
- Confirm reporting period dates are correct
- Check for changes in data definitions or classifications
- Verify all data sources included in calculations
- Review for any system changes affecting data capture

**Solutions**:
1. **Data tracing**: Follow specific figures back to source records
2. **Period comparison**: Check same period in previous year for context
3. **External validation**: Cross-check with other data sources where possible
4. **Documentation review**: Check for any policy or system changes
5. **Early submission**: Submit draft returns early for feedback where possible

### Common Issue 3: "Charts and graphs not displaying correctly"

**Problem**: Visual displays not showing data properly or missing information
**Technical checks**:
- Browser compatibility and version
- Data volume - too much data for visualization
- Filter settings - overly restrictive criteria
- Permission issues - access to underlying data

**Solutions**:
1. **Browser update**: Use latest version of supported browser
2. **Data sampling**: Use date ranges or filters to reduce data volume
3. **Filter review**: Check all filter settings for appropriate criteria
4. **Permission check**: Verify access rights to all required data sources
5. **Alternative formats**: Try different chart types or export options
