## System Information
- **URL**: https://pp-idoxqa-automation.staging.idoxcloud.com/
- **Method**: HTTP-based HTML analysis
- **Limitations**: Cannot interact with JavaScript, may miss dynamic content

## Analysis Results

### Form Fields Found
- No form fields found

### Navigation Elements
- No navigation elements found

### All Links Found



## Recommendations

### For Full Navigation Documentation:
1. **Use Browser Automation**: Run the full Playwright script on a system with browser support
2. **Manual Documentation**: Use the manual template provided
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Combine this analysis with manual exploration

### Possible Navigation Patterns:
Based on typical web applications and the links found, the Idox system likely has:
- Top-level modules accessible after login
- Left navigation menus within each module
- Create/Edit forms for different record types
- Search and reporting functionality

### Next Steps:
1. Run the full Playwright script: `node scripts/document-idox-navigation.js`
2. Or use Docker: `./scripts/run-with-docker.sh`
3. Or document manually using the template
