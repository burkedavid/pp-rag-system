## GIS and New Map Interface

We have introduced an improved map interface accompanied by new GIS functionality into the Public Protection system. The following article will review the new map interface, including details of layers, guidance on how to draw polygons and useful new features such as Street View.

### New Maps Interface

The new maps interface will be found throughout the system including Premises, Locations, Notices and Licences and even appears in admin areas (specific to ward allocation). It should be noted that the map interface and specifically the available menu options will vary dependent upon the area of the system the map is accessed from.

The following article will cover the basic functionality available when using the new map interface, as will as reviewing some of the additional menu options and what they do.

### Basic Overview

Anytime a map button is clicked in the Public Protection system, the map interface will open in a new tab.

Users can interact with the map itself, left clicking to drag the focal point of the map and using the scroll wheel to zoom in and out. The menu options found along the top of the modal itself, will offer additional functionality as follows:

- Display
- Search

Let's take a look below at the menu options available and what each of them allows the user to do when accessed throughout the Public Protection product.

#### Display

The Display option allows us to change the map interface by interchanging various layers, re-centering on the location we are working on and entering street view mode.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Background Layer/Map | This option defines the general background layer used for the Map interface. The options available here will be dependent on those available to your council area or those which you may have provided to Idox: OSM |
| Layers | This option allows the user to select the layers that can be added to your Map interface. The options available here will be dependent on those available to your council area or those which you may have provided to Idox: Locations (displays all available locations from within the Public Protection system - clicking on a location point on the map will display additional address information in the top right hand corner of the map interface). |
| Recentre | Recentres the map based on the Location the map was accessed from. |
| Street View | Click this option to start street view. The mouse pointer will change to a crosshair allowing the user to click a point on the map at which point street view will open in a new tab. |

#### Search

The search option allows users to query the map by entering specific location details.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Location Search | Used to search various places, streets, post codes etc and move the map focus to that searched area. |

### Advanced Functionality

The new map interface offers advanced functionality. Users may already be familiar with the ability to draw polygons for the purposes of Ward Allocation, however the use of polygons has now been extended further with both Premises and Licence Modules offering a "GIS" left hand menu against their records.

#### GIS Left Hand Menu

The GIS Left Hand Menu, allows users to plot a polygon against that record. Once the polygon has been plotted and saved, then an image is captured and stored against the front screen of the record.

**Note:** Additional functionality around polygons and the GIS left hand menu will likely be introduced over the coming months and years.

#### Draw

The Draw menu is where users will be able to start drawing their polygons.
