<h1>Home Page - Team Lead Overview</h1>

<p>We have created a new home page specifically designed with Team Leads in mind. In order to view this home page, users will need to configure it against their user profile.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/StartedPP_FILES/Screenshot_121217_115120_AM.jpg"></p>

<p>Users wishing to use the Team Lead Overview should note that additional configuration is required against their user settings in Admin. Users will be required to select which officers and which modules they want to appear in the Team Lead Overview.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/StartedPP_FILES/Screenshot_121217_024551_PM.jpg"></p>

<p>Once the Team Lead Overview option has been selected and the admin configured, the Team Lead Overview should be ready for use, and will look something similar to this.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/StartedPP_FILES/Screenshot_121217_034318_PM.jpg"></p>

<p>Along the left hand side users will be presented with an overview for those modules in the system that were selected. To the right users will then see a specific breakdown on this information for each selected user.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the user specific details, clicking into each module (Inspections, Service Requests etc) will give a breakdown specific to that user. Furthermore, clicking on the number here will present a list of the specific records which in turn can be used to link direct into the record itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>The Tascomi Public Protection solution is a web-based product which has been developed in conjunction with Tascomi users through continual development and improvement, in order to meet the demanding needs of Local Authority Public Protection staff.</p>

<p>The purpose of this document is to explain each of the functional areas of the solution for use by end users. The manual is designed to explain how to operate the software but has not been designed to describe the associated processes and workflows which will may used with the software as these can be often updated and changed in line with the customer’s requirements.</p>

<p>For system administration and maintenance, please see the Tascomi Public Protection System Administration Manual.</p>

<p>Being browser based users are therefore able to access the solution using any compatible web browser. Please note however, that it is essential to use an up to date web browser with the software; this should be the latest or previous browser release unless agreed otherwise with Tascomi. Supported web browsers include the latest versions of Internet Explorer, Firefox, Google Chrome and Apple Safari.</p>

<p>Access to options within the solution will be subject to suitable security permissions within each of the module areas. This can be set using the 'Admin' module by users with appropriate permissions - refer to the System Administration Manual as noted above for guidance on this.</p>

<p>The solution is designed to be very intuitive and Tascomi recommend that users read the following section of this document as a minimum which explains the standard conventions used throughout the solution.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Password Recovery and Maintenance</h1>

<p><strong>Password Recovery</strong></p>

<p>If the user enters an invalid username and password combination, they will be presented with a password recovery screen. A user will have three incorrect login attempts before their individual account is 'Locked' and must be re-enabled by the Organisation's local System Administrator. The password recovery screen however will allow the user to enter their valid username a new password will be generated and sent to the email address registered against their individual user record.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/StartedPP_FILES/5.png"></p>

<p>If an invalid username is entered, the user will be informed. Upon entering a valid username and clicking 'Submit' the solution will prompt the user to check their email.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/StartedPP_FILES/6.png"></p>

<p><strong>Password Maintenance</strong></p>

<p>All users should ensure that they change the default password issues to them for initial login. In addition, passwords should be changed as required by an Organisation's ICT security protocol. To change the password click on the username in the top right of the screen beside 'logged in as'. This opens the ‘User Details’ screen.</p>

<p>To change a password:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Delete the contents of both Password fields in the User Details screen</li>
	<li>Enter a new password in the first Password field</li>
	<li>Confirm this password by re-typing it into the second Password field</li>
	<li>Click 'Save' to update the changes or click 'Home' to go to the home page without saving the changes</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note: the password fields display a 'mask' which obscures both the characters used and the length of the password recorded. Always erase such an entry before inputting a new password. Also, Tascomi advise that any 'Remember Passwords' functionality available within the web browser in use is disabled for both security and practical reasons when updating/resetting passwords.</strong></p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>How to Edit User Details</h1>

<p>It is very important that Tascomi Public Protection Users keep their details up to date within the system for both account validity and password recovery as well as system-generated communication purposes. To check user details at any time click on the username in the top right of the screen beside 'logged in as'. This opens the ‘User Details’ screen, allowing the following details to be amended:</p>

<table class="table table-bordered" style="height:198px; width:752px">

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Days to View</h1>

<p>The days to view option allows the user to configure the global parameter for the number of calendar days to display (looking forward) in relation with the 'Overview' Home Screen setting.</p>

<p>Please note that changing this setting will impact all users. A suggested default value would be to view information 30 days ahead for example. Target or schedule items (such as inspections due) that fall within this range will be displayed for users under the appropriate heading on their individual home screen.</p>

<p>Selecting this option displays the current value with the option to change the number if required.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Logging In &amp; Out</h1>

<p><strong>Logging In</strong></p>

<p>Prior to attempting to login to the Tascomi Public Protection solution, users will need a valid Username and Password which will have initially been setup by a System Administrator.</p>

<p>In order to log into the solution users will first need to open a web browser and enter the appropriate URL (Uniform Resource Locator - the solution's web address). Please note that it can therefore be useful to have the URL for the Organisation's particular solution setup as a shortcut or in a quick-launch menu.</p>

<p>By entering the correct URL the user will be presented with the initial login screen displayed in the following example:</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/StartedPP_FILES/4.png"></p>

<p>&nbsp;In order to login users will need to enter their own valid Username and Password followed by either clicking on the 'Log in' button or pressing the &lt;Return&gt; key. It is essential that users only utilise their own accounts and that accounts are subsequently not 'shared' between groups of users. This is not only for security reasons but also practical working considerations: only unique users will be able to monitor their current allocated work via the Homescreen. Please ensure that credentials are kept safe. Users should ensure that their use of the solution adheres to the Council's own ICT Security policy.</p>

<p>If the password is entered incorrectly, the forgotten password screen will be displayed. To return to the Login page and try again, press the 'Home' button on the user interface's top menu.</p>

<p>To prevent the individual user account being locked, users can make use of the Password Recovery facility to generate a new password (via email) to gain access to the system without having to contact the local System Administrator. Please note that email functionality and a user email address within their profile need to be configured in order to support the password recovery feature. Tascomi will not be able to assist with forgotten passwords or locked user accounts once the system is in live use: the email password recovery or an Organisation's local System Administrator should be employed in these instances for security reasons.</p>

<p><strong>Logging Out</strong></p>

<p>Users should always log out of the solution when it is not in use i.e. at the end of a shift or when going on a break. A logout button is provided in the top right hand corner of the screen for this purpose.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>How to Navigate the Software Solution</h1>

<h2>Navigation Standards within Tascomi Public Protection</h2>

<p>This section details all of the standard conventions used within the system, which are relevant across all module areas.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Drop Down Code lists</h2>

<p>Drop down code lists are used throughout the software solution. When entering data using drop down code lists, users can choose the required item by selecting the relevant item from a vertical list of applicable choices.</p>

<p>In addition, users can enter the relevant unique code followed by pressing the tab button. When entering text in a drop down list, many of the controls will carry out a search and limit the displayed results. In these instances, tabbing off the field will choose the first item in the list.</p>

<p>Please note that drop down code lists display the code followed by the name description. Once an item has been selected, the description is returned and entered into the box. The code is only intended for quick entry of the information. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Multi-Select Lists</h2>

<p>Multi-select fields are used in some parts of the application allowing multiple values to be recorded in relation with a single field.</p>

<p>Users choose the codes in the same way as with drop down code lists though in these instances, can repeat the process numerous times to add further codes to the selection.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Icons &amp; Menu Options</h2>

<p>A single click of an icon or menu heading option takes the user to the selected menu option. Please ensure that data on the current screen is saved prior to navigating to another web page. &nbsp;If the current information has not been saved (or auto-saved) the user will be prompted to do so.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/StartedPP_FILES/typical data entry (SR) 1.PNG" style="height:306px; width:549px"></p>

<h2>Breadcrumb Trail</h2>

<p>Following selection of an icon/menu heading the breadcrumb trail e.g. Home &gt; Requests &gt; Create will be updated to reflect the users current location within the solution which is displayed just below menu icons at the top left of screen.</p>

<p>Users can change their current location either by clicking on another menu option or by using the breadcrumb trails to navigate 'backward' to the desired location. NOTE: Please do not use the browser's own 'Back'/'Forward' buttons to perform this function; the caching of data during these browser steps may lead to errors or data not being saved. Always use the menu options or the breadcrumb trails for navigation.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Opening Records</h2>

<p>Tascomi recommend making good use of the right click on all menus and icons which displays the option "Open in New Tab" functionality. This allows the user to open the information in a new browser tab. This will help when trying to view related records as it will mean the original record/screen will remain open. This facility can be used across the solution meaning that individual records can be opened as a multitude this way.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Close Button</h2>

<p>When viewing a record, clicking the ‘Close’ button returns the user to the initial list/module area from where they selected the record.</p>

<h2>Browser Functionality</h2>

<p>Dependent on the web browser used, there are some very useful additional elements of functionality that can be employed. Options and their associated commands do vary between different browsers however, these will include:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Spell Checker</strong> - The spell checker is standard within many browsers and will automatically underline incorrect spellings with a red line which can be corrected manually where required</li>
	<li><strong>Print</strong> - The standard print facility within a web browser is accessed via &lt;Control&gt; and &lt;P&gt; which allows the user to print to available print devices. Print and page options vary by browser however</li>
	<li><strong>Find</strong> - Most screens within the solution support the standard search facility within the web browser. This is available from the browser edit menu or typically by using &lt;Control&gt; and &lt;F&gt;. This can be very useful when navigating pages of search results. Some browsers also have a ‘Match Case’ option in relation to ‘Find’ and Tascomi recommend that this be switched off</li>
	<li><strong>Cut/Copy/Paste</strong> – Users are able to cut, copy and paste text from/to text fields throughout the solution. These options are available from the edit menu of the browser or using standard shortcut keys for Cut, copy and paste which are &lt;Control&gt; and &lt;X&gt;, &lt;C&gt; and &lt;V&gt; (on PC) respectively</li>
	<li><strong>Resizing Browser Text/Zoom</strong> – The &lt;Control&gt; key and + or – will enlarge the browser text, effectively 'zooming' the view in or out. This functionality is supported by most modern browsers</li>
	<li><strong>Resizing of text entry boxes</strong> - This facility is available where additional lines appear around the bottom right hand corner of a text box. This is available within the Mozilla Firefox web browser</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Browser Navigation</h2>

<p>Tascomi kindly advise that users do not use the navigation toolbars (for Back/Forward) within the web browser as the solution has not been designed to work in this way. Please use the on screen user interface options such as buttons, icons and menu heading options.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Tab Key</h2>

<p>When navigating data entry screens, the tab key can be used to move from field to field as an alternative to using the mouse. By holding the &lt;Shift&gt; key together with pressing &lt;Tab&gt; users can move in reverse order between fields on a data entry screen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Sorting Lists</h2>

<p>When displaying lists of records (including following a search) in each of the module areas users can change the order of the list by clicking the corresponding column heading. Clicking the column heading again re-sorts the column in the opposite order. Please note that only a single column sort can be applied to a record list results screen at a time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Entry Of Dates</h2>

<p>Dates can either be entered by clicking on the corresponding calendar control or entered manually. When entering dates manually, the date will be automatically formatted without needing to enter any characters to separate elements of the date (so for instance 010110 becomes 01/01/2010 or 1st January 2010). Alternatively, entering the letter ‘t’ defaults to the current date and can speed up entry of new information on the current day.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/StartedPP_FILES/typical search entry (SR) 2.PNG" style="height:243px; width:551px"></p>

<h2>Different Field Types</h2>

<p>The following field types are used throughout screens in Tascomi Public Protection:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>Display-only</em> information is displayed without a border and cannot be changed by the user</li>
	<li><em>Text entry</em> of field data can take place on fields with a white background</li>
	<li><em>Drop down list (DDL)</em> fields are indicated by a down arrow symbol to the right hand side of a field with a white background. Users are able to enter information into drop down fields either manually or by clicking on the down arrow and selecting the required option (see above)</li>
	<li><em>Check box</em> fields allow user to click a box to either check or un-check an option</li>
	<li><em>Radio buttons</em> are circular buttons which usually restrict entry to a single option (though may be from two or more choices) in response to a question</li>
</ul>

<h2>Record Lists</h2>

<p>When displaying lists of records the number of records displayed on the screen is limited to 30 at a time. This ensures that the users experience optimum performance. A record list can be refined if required to bring back more specific information. Where multiple pages of results are displayed, the user has the option to click on the relevant page number or click on the ‘Previous’, ‘First’, ‘Next’ or ‘Last’ pagination links.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/StartedPP_FILES/view record list example (SR).PNG" style="height:256px; width:540px"></p>

<p><strong>Left Hand Menu Options</strong></p>

<p>Following selection of a module area the user is provided with a list of the available options on the left hand side of the screen. This will be split into additional options for the module selected together with access to additional related information. For the links to additional information, 'tick' icons alongside the headings (Inspections, File Attachments, Actions etc.) indicate the information is recorded and available to view.</p>

<p>The left hand menu (LHM) options available for selection differ dependent on the module area selected, although there are a high proportion of common options, which are available across all module areas.</p>

<p>When selecting a left hand menu option the user is presented with a list of existing records where applicable which can be viewed or edited dependent on user security privileges. Choosing the option to 'add/create' will create a new record in the selected area.</p>

<p>The common options on the left hand menu (LHM) available across the module areas are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>View</strong>&nbsp;- Will return the user to the main record, i.e. the premise, complaint, sample, the user opened</li>
	<li><strong>Inspections&nbsp;</strong>- Allows the user to add an inspection record to the record. In some module areas users may be able to create inspections in bulk against related records</li>
	<li><strong>Actions&nbsp;</strong>- This left hand menu allows the user to record an action record in relation to the master record. An action can be used to record any activity in relation with the master record as well as entering actions that need to take place in the future</li>
	<li><strong>Notices&nbsp;</strong>- This left hand menu allows the user to record an enforcement record in relation to the master record. These records allow information to record legal action that has taken place</li>
	<li><strong>Correspondence&nbsp;</strong>- The correspondence left hand menu option allows the user to create standard documentation/letters in relation to the master record using pre-defined templates. Templates are configured to include 'merge' information from data that has been recorded such as address detail</li>
	<li><strong>File Uploads&nbsp;</strong>- This option allows the user to attach certain types of file to the master record. It is important to note that only users that have suitable software can view associated files which are subsequently attached. Tascomi recommended therefore that standard or generic formats such as PDF, GIF and JPG are used to ensure that users can view the attached information. In addition, users need to be aware of the size of images such as photographs that are being attached. Many modern cameras/phones take very high resolution photographs which will result in a large file size which has both storage and retrieval consequences, particularly when operating on a mobile device</li>
	<li><strong>Emails </strong>- This option allows the user to attach emails to the master record.</li>
	<li><strong>Additional contacts </strong>- This option allows the user to record additional contacts on a&nbsp;record, such as solicitors or head office information.</li>
</ul>

<h1>How to Use your Homepage</h1>

<p>After logging in, the user will be presented with their Homepage/Home screen.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/StartedPP_FILES/PP4.jpg"></p>

<p>In some situations, users may be offered an alternative list of programs. This will typically depend on the organisation and user role as to any variation(s) on offer.</p>

<p>By default, this presents a list of all modules that the user has access to.</p>

<p>Each module area displays as a section with a total number of records for each section. There is a limit of 100 records per area per user on the homepage. Clicking on a section's '+' symbol displays a list of the outstanding work for that module area.</p>

<p>Once an item of work has been completed by entering the completed date for the task/item, the record will no longer appear in the Homepage for the user.</p>

<p>Clicking on the 'Home' icon button at any time returns the user to the Homepage.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000"><u><strong>NB - Please be aware that this article has been reproduced from a similar guide found on our NI Enviro help centre. Please pardon any discrepancies&nbsp;found in the included&nbsp;screenshots whilst we update and finalise this article. Users should still find this guide useful however in understanding the basic functionality offered by Online Food Business Registrations.&nbsp;</strong></u></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>Together with Tascomi's Public Protection product, the Food Standards Agency website allows food business owners to register their food business online. Any registration submitted via the FSA website will now appear within the Public Protection product ready to be processed.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Admin Privilege</strong></p>

<p>Within the user admin area (Admin &gt; General &gt;Select User) an additional permission has been added 'Online Food Business Registrations' as indicated in the screenshot below:&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Premises_FILES/A.PNG"></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The introduction of Online Food Premise Registrations has prompted additional fields within the Premise Food tab - this is to cater for the information captured within the online food registration form. As requested, we have recently applied a change whereby users will not require the Online Food Business Registration permission in order to view the additional fields within the Premises Food Tab.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Online Food Business Registrations</strong></p>

<p>Upon applying the aforementioned user permission this will then display an additional left hand menu area for Online Food Business Registrations which can be accessed by navigating to the Premises Module.</p>

<p>There is also a numeric value displayed which indicates how many online registrations have been received and are awaiting processing.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Premises_FILES/B.PNG"></p>

<p><strong>Processing An Online Food Registration</strong></p>

<p>In order to process the online food registration record the first step of the user is to review the information that has been provided in relation to the premise to ensure the information is accurate. Much like other types of online submission, they should be reviewed top to bottom then left to right.</p>

<p>The online record will appear similar to what is shown in the screenshot below:</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Premises_FILES/C.PNG"></p>

<p>The user will need to review any read/write fields and&nbsp;update/populate these as appropriate: for example, Food Main Usage Code, Responsible Officer and Responsible Team.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>The next stage of processing is matching both the Premises Details and the Operator Details with premise and contact records already on the system. Please note that the system will automatically attempt to match, both the premise and operator, and these details will populate the matched column should an appropriate match be found. If this information is not correct the following steps should be followed accordingly.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Within the premises details section select the 'search' button located to the right hand side of the record as highlighted in the screenshot below:&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Premises_FILES/D.png"></p>

<p>Upon selecting the 'search' button the user will be displayed with the Premises Search screen as shown in the screenshot below:</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Premises_FILES/E.PNG"></p>

<p>It is recommended that users carry out the search first as this is used to identify if the premise already exists on the system to avoid duplication of premises. Upon selecting search if result(s) are returned the user will then need to select the appropriate premise record that relates to the online record. If the system returns no results this would indicate that the premise has not been recorded on the system previously and will need to be created.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In order to create the premise the user will need to select the 'Create Premises From Online Details' checkbox which will display an additional 'Premise Location Details' section:</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Premises_FILES/F.PNG"></p>

<p>The user will then need to follow the search process and search for the location of the premise, if result(s) are returned they will then select the appropriate location as indicated in the following screenshot:</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Premises_FILES/G.PNG"></p>

<p>This will then match the location and completes the matching step for the 'Premise Details' section of the record.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Premises_FILES/H.PNG"></p>

<p>If no results are returned from the search the user will then need to select the 'Create Location From Online Details' checkbox which will create the location upon acceptance of the record.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Premises_FILES/I.PNG"></p>

<p>The same process from above will need to be completed within the Operator Details section beginning with the matching of the operator. The user will need to first search using the 'Search' button to check if the operator already exists within the system.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Premises_FILES/J.PNG"></p>

<p>If no results are found via the search or from by the suggested contacts functionality the user will then need to create the contact based on the information provided in the record. This can be done by selecting the 'Create Contact From Online Details' checkbox:</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Premises_FILES/L.PNG"></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The 'Suggested Contacts' button is available to provide the user with a list of additional potential matches found by the system based on the operator details submitted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Upon matching all of the information on the right hand side of the record and ensuring all of the information has been populated on the left hand side the user can then proceed with the Acceptance of the online food registration record.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Premises_FILES/M.PNG"></p>

<p>An additional checkbox has been added to the online food registration area which allows users to determine if the record upon acceptance should create an initial inspection entry. In the scenario whereby the Premise does not require a initial inspection record to be automatically generated this checkbox should remain blank.</p>

<p>This particular checkbox will be useful when matching an online food registration record with an existing food premise within the system where a current FHPI inspection may already be scheduled or perhaps if a new premise requires further review before an initial inspection should be scheduled.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the food premise record requires an initial inspection, the user would ensure the 'Create Initial Inspection' checkbox is selected before accepting. This will then create/match the record within the Premises Module with the relevant information as well as generating the food inspection.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;We have implemented additional emailing functionality, similar to the rejection emails process whereby the applicant will receive an email to notify them when their online food registration has been accepted.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Rejecting Applications</strong></p>

<p>When rejecting an online food premise registration the user has the ability to send out further information to the applicant in relation to why the application has been rejected. The user would enter this information within the 'Rejection Reason' text-box followed by selecting the 'Send Rejection Email' checkbox and finalising this by selecting the 'Reject' button. The applicant will then receive an email notifying them of the rejected application including any reasoning information added by the processing user.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Tracking Food Premises without Initial Inspection</strong></p>

<p>We have added an additional checkbox within the Premises Search screen '<em>Online Registrations Without Inspection</em>' which will allow users to report on premises that have been created without an initial inspection and the returned results can be exported to Microsoft Word/Excel if required.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Premises_FILES/OnlineRegWithoutInsp.JPG"></p>

<h1>Show Premise Info - Contextual Overview</h1>

<p>When managing a Premise with multiple left hand menu options including inspections, actions, communications etc,&nbsp;a lot of information may be available over multiple screens. In order to provide an overview/context behind a Premise, users will notice a Show Premise Info button at the top right hand corner of their screen.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Premises_FILES/Screenshot_060517_103403_AM.jpg"></p>

<p>The Show Premise Info button will be present across all Left Hand Menu options including when users are adding inspections. Clicking on the button will open a pop up modal on the screen and will present a host of information, relative to the core functions a premise is registered for. The relevant tabs only get populated with information if the premises has at least one inspection with that Core Function against the premises.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Premises_FILES/Screenshot_061217_032011_PM.jpg"></p>

<p>Users can navigate through the available core functions by clicking on the appropriate tab.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Introduction to Premises</h1>

<p>Premises information stored within the Tascomi Public Protection solution allows authorised users to view, search and create premises.</p>

<p>A 'Premises' can be a&nbsp;building's address where domestic and commercial activity takes place i.e. Food inspections &amp; Grant Applications&nbsp;but a&nbsp;premises can&nbsp;also be a ship (Port Health), a vehicle (Licencing) and land (Contaminated Land). &nbsp;A&nbsp;premises record will be linked to an existing location (address) and is where any associated information is stored relating to functional areas that have been registered at the premises.</p>

<p>To enter this area, select the 'Premises' icon at the top of the screen which presents the available premises options on the left hand side (dependent on the users available security privileges).</p>

<p>Upon entering the Premise module, the user will be taken to the 'View Premises' option automatically listing all the address records which have associated open and trading premises details against them.</p>

<p>Please note that by default, any premises records that are closed (have ceased trading)&nbsp;<strong>may not be displayed&nbsp;</strong>on this initial 'View Premises' list but can be obtained by running a search (Search Premises) to include closed premises in addition, or only closed premises. This setting is dependent on initial configuration by Tascomi and may therefore differ if requested to be by a particular Organisation's preference.</p>

<h1>How to View List of Premises saved on system</h1>

<p>When clicking the Premises icon, a list of all open premises in the database is displayed automatically, allowing users to drill down on the individual records to view full information and related details by clicking on an individual record.</p>

<p>By selecting this option the following screen is displayed:</p>

<p>&nbsp;<img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Premises_FILES/premises1.png" style="height:217px; width:730px"></p>

<h1>How to Create a Premises</h1>

<p>Access to the Create Premise option should be restricted for use by a subset of users to ensure that the quality of the premise database is not compromised and to guard against the entry of duplicate records. Prior to creating new premise records Tascomi recommend that it is necessary good practice to use the ‘Search Premises’ option to check for existing records at the same location.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When clicking on the Create Premise option in the left hand menu, the user is presented with the following screen:</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Premises_FILES/premises2.png" style="height:373px; width:738px"></p>

<p>The user is able to create a new premise record based on their requirements. By mandatory default, information must be completed on the screen above together with at least one contact record, along with registration information for any of the areas checked on the right hand side of the screen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fields for completion on this screen are as follows:</p>

Following the completion of the relevant fields the new record will be created after clicking the ‘Save’ button at the bottom of the screen. Please note that the mandatory fields indicated above need to be completed together with at least one contact record and registration information relating to any of the registered function areas, i.e. food as previously mentioned, else the record will not create.</p>

<h1>How to Search a Premises &amp; Saved Searches</h1>

<p>The Search Premises option allows the user to carry out a custom search based on premises data stored within the database.</p>

<p>The option allows users to enter as little or as much information from the premise record including information recorded in relation to the premise location, related names and addresses, as well as information relating to specific module areas. Users have the option to choose the relevant individual tabs at the top of the search screen in order to find information relating to a specific module area. By selecting this option the user is presented with the following screen:</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Premises_FILES/search premises.png" style="height:284px; width:680px">&nbsp;</p>

<p>The user is able to search for premises information by entering the relevant information for any of the text, date, or drop down list fields across any of the tabs. The search results are then displayed in familiar list form at the bottom of the screen once 'Search' is clicked or the user presses &lt;Return&gt;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following execution of the search query the user is able to print the results of the screen using the standard browser control of &lt;Control&gt; and &lt;P&gt; or they may choose to export the results into MS Excel or MS Word format by clicking the appropriate button.</p>

<p>When entering information in text fields users can utilise the wildcard character within search strings. The standard wildcard search option is the ‘%’ symbol, which can be entered at the start or in the middle of text strings.</p>

<p>For example, by entering ‘%hotel’ in the premise name field, the results will return all premises names which contain the word 'hotel' in any part of the character string. It is not necessary to add a wildcard symbol to the end of a search string as the system automatically applies this during the search execution (hence a premises name search for 'B' is effectively 'B%' and will return Brendans, Brendans Bar and Brannigans Hotel hypothetically).</p>

<p>Please note that the ‘Include Closed’ option is not usually checked by default, which therefore then automatically excludes closed premises records from typical search results. If closed premises records are required, the ‘Include Closed’ checkbox can be cleared to then include closed premises records.</p>

<h1>View Individual Premises Details</h1>

<h1>Change Premises Name</h1>

<p>The Change Premises Name feature allows users to make valid changes to the premises name and retain an historic audit trail of previous names.</p>

<p>Tascomi only recommend the use of this feature following a trading name change. If an owner of a premises changes, we would recommend entering a 'Closure' date on the premises record and creating a new premises&nbsp;<strong>to ensure that the history relates to the previous owner and does not get transferred to the new owner.</strong></p>

<p>Clicking on the 'Change Premises Name' option at the bottom of the premises screen presents the user with the following screen requesting entry of the new premises name together with the date that the change was made. Users must click on the 'save' button to effect this change.</p>

<p>Once the changes have been saved, the current record is updated and an item of history is automatically added to the record with the previous details.</p>

<p>Once the notice form has been completed, the user should click save in order to create the notice. The above guidance should also assist in cases where a notice is being edited, subject of course to the user having the correct permissions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notice Left Hand Menu</p>

<p>Now that Notices exist as part of their own module, each Notice created will have it's own left hand menu where additional tasks can be carried out.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Notice_FILES/NoticeMenu.JPG"></p>

<p><strong>View Notice</strong></p>

<p>The View Notice left hand menu will always take the user back to the overview screen for the Notice that they are working on.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Actions</strong></p>

<p>The Actions left hand menu allows users to create Actions and Actions Schedules. Functionality here is similar to that found elsewhere in the system. Please be sure to check out our help centre article on Actions to learn more.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Communications</strong></p>

<p>The Communications left hand menu allows users to create Communications and also send these via email if necessary. Functionality here is similar to that found elsewhere in the system. Please be sure to check out our help centre article on Communications to learn more.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Uploaded Files</strong></p>

<p>The Uploaded Files left hand menu allows users to save files against the Notice record. Functionality here is similar to that found elsewhere in the system. Please be sure to check out our help centre article on Uploaded Files to learn more.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Seized Goods</strong></p>

<p>The Seized Goods left hand menu is an area unique to Notices. This allows users to record additional details concerning seized goods.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To add a row, click the "Add Seized Goods" button.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Notice_FILES/seized goods.PNG"></p>

<p>Users will then be presented with a number of fields in order to record the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Seized From</li>
	<li>Seized At</li>
	<li>Date Removed</li>
	<li>Type of Good</li>
	<li>Brand</li>
	<li>Seal Number</li>
	<li>Quantity</li>
	<li>Value</li>
	<li>Officer&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Disposal Date</li>
	<li>Disposal Details</li>
</ul>

<p>Users can add as many rows as is necessary by using the Add Seized Good; equally rows can e removed by using the Remove button adjacent to the row.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once completed the user should remember to click Save.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Online Details</strong></p>

<p>The Online Details left hand menu option allows users to control, on an individual notice record, what information appears on the public portal. More information regarding this area can be found <a href="https://public-protection.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010221458">here</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Online Details/ Public Portal</h1>

<p>This article will detail the online details functionality added within the Notices Module which gives end users the ability to determine what information is displayed via the public portal.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Notice_FILES/OnlineDetailsAdd.JPG"></p>

<p>To begin configuring this information users should navigate to the Online Details left hand menu and click Add as illustrated above to begin.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Notice_FILES/OnlineDetailsFields.JPG"></p>

<table class="table table-bordered" style="height:170px; width:558px">

			<td style="width:182px">Public Uploads</td>
			<td style="width:353px">Ticking this will allow documents to be displayed on the public portal for viewing.&nbsp;</td>

	</tbody>
</table>

<p>Upon completing the configuration, the user must then select 'Save' to apply the changes to this particular notice record.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: The online configuration must be saved before you can set up the public visibility of documents.</p>

<p><strong>Public Documents</strong></p>

<p>The same document redaction functionality was previously implemented within the systems licensing module that provided users with the ability to redact/censor documents where appropriate before sharing the document via the public portal.</p>

<p>This will enable users to publish files on the online portal whilst redacting certain sensitive information from public view.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How to redact a document and share it via the Public Portal&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. Upload document via the Uploaded Files left hand menu.&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. Once the document has been uploaded successfully, the file will then be present within the online details area as shown below. The user would then select the 'Redact' button for the relevant file.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Notice_FILES/RedactButton.JPG"></p>

<p>3. The Redaction Tool will be loaded in a new tab within your browser.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Notice_FILES/redactionTool.JPG"></p>

<p>Point and click on the document to start redacting information. Information should be redacted line by line. Clicking once will indicate the start of the redaction line, and clicking again on the horizontal axis will mark the end of the redaction line.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Notice_FILES/redaction1.JPG"></p>

<p>Users will note some additional functionality found within the redaction screen which functions as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Hide/Show Redaction - Click between hiding and showing the information displayed underneath the redaction lines.</li>
	<li>Redact - Click to enable the Redaction tool to begin redacting information.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Redact Slider - Slide to increase/decrease the size of the redaction tool.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Arrows - Click to move the document position within the tab.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Plus/Minus Sign - Click to Zoom in and Out</li>
	<li>Rotate Sign - Click to rotate the document.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Undo - Undo last change</li>
	<li>Redo - Redo last undone change.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Clear - Clears all redaction lines from document.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Save - Saves the document with applied changes.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Layers - Will allow users to remove redaction lines individually.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>4. When the relevant areas of the file have been redacted/censored the user must then select the 'Save' option. A green banner will appear temporarily to confirm the save was successful. Once this is confirmed, the tab can be closed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>5. Reviewing the file within the Online Details configuration&nbsp;area you will now see a small icon of the Redacted document beside the redact button. The icon can be clicked in order to download a copy of the redacted document.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Notice_FILES/redactedDoc1.JPG"></p>

<p>Provided that the Online Details are configured for live, clicking the Public checkbox will ready the redacted document for sharing via the portal.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: All documents saved in the Uploaded Files left hand menu will appear here to share on the public portal. For those that have not previously been redacted the above redaction process would be used.</p>

<p>If a document&nbsp;is acceptable to share on the public portal without redaction, then the Bypass checkbox should be ticked as appropriate.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Notice_FILES/ByPass.JPG"></p>

<p>Upon completing the above steps the end user would then ensure the 'Publish Uploads' checkbox has been selected followed by saving the changes made to the online details configuration for the notice record.&nbsp;</p>

			<h1>Batch Print</h1>

			<p>The Batch Print left hand menu allows users to batch print notices which have not previously been printed or emailed.&nbsp;</p>

			<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Notice_FILES/Batch Print.PNG"></p>

			<p>Users can use the search areas provided to refine and limit their results as required. Once the results have been returned, users can select those notices they wish to print by checking the checkbox on the right hand side. Alternatively all returned results can be selected at once, by selecting the top most checkbox.&nbsp;</p>

			<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Notice_FILES/batch print selected.PNG"></p>

			<p>Once happy with their selection, the user should click "Batch Print Selected".&nbsp;</p>

			<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Notice_FILES/batch print verify.PNG"></p>

			<p>The user should then verify their decision by selecting "OK" in order to proceed with the Batch Print. At this point the selected Notices will appear in a pop up (print dialogue box), ready to be printed as appropriate.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>When checking the target Notices, users will see the Notice in the Communications left hand menu, as well as noting that the "Date Sent" field will populate.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Important Considerations</p>

			<ul>
				<li>In order to batch print a notice, the notice type against each notice must have an associated notice communication set against it.&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Include Printed Checkbox: Checking this as part of your Batch Print search will include previously printed Notices. Any notice that is printed a second time will update the "Date Sent" field as well as sourcing the originally created notice. NB - A new communication will not be generated - the purpose of this option is to allow a batch to be reprinted if the initial batch were to fail due to a printer issue for example.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<h1>Batch Print Reminders</h1>

			<p>The Batch Print Reminders left hand menu allows users to batch print reminders.</p>

			<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Notice_FILES/batch print reminders.PNG"></p>

			<p>Users can use the search areas provided to refine and limit their results as required.&nbsp;</p>

			<p><strong>NB - Notices returned here will be based on the Reminder Communication Days set in the Notice Types Admin area.&nbsp;</strong></p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Once the results have been returned, users can select those notice reminders they wish to print by checking the checkbox on the right hand side. Alternatively all returned results can be selected at once, by selecting the top most checkbox.&nbsp;</p>

			<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Notice_FILES/batch print selected.PNG"></p>

			<p>Once happy with their selection, the user should click "Batch Print Selected".&nbsp;</p>

			<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Notice_FILES/batch print verify.PNG"></p>

			<p>The user should then verify their decision by selecting "OK" in order to proceed with the Batch Print. At this point the selected Notice Reminders will appear in a pop up (print dialogue box), ready to be printed as appropriate.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>When checking the target Notices, users will see the Notice in the Communications left hand menu, as well as noting that the "Date Sent" field will populate.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Important Considerations</p>

			<ul>
				<li>In order to batch print a notice reminder, the notice type against each notice must have an associated notice reminder communication set against it. Also the Notice Sent field must be populated.</li>
				<li>Include Printed Checkbox: Checking this as part of your Batch Print search will include previously printed Notice Reminders. Any notice reminder that is printed a second time will update the "Date Reminder Sent" field as well as sourcing the originally created notice. NB - A new communication will not be generated - the purpose of this option is to allow a batch to be reprinted if the initial batch were to fail due to a printer issue for example.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<h1>Notices Overview</h1>

			<p>We have added a new Notices Overview to compliment the new Notices Module. This Overview can be set via the Homepage dropdown found against your user profile. Once set here, clicking on the Home Module will display the Notices Overview.&nbsp;</p>

			<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Notice_FILES/overview.PNG"></p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Each area presented in the Notices Overview area can be expanded upon by clicking the relevant VIEW+ button. Clicking this will present a list of Notices that meet the criteria for the area you have expanded. The criteria are set out below:</p>

			<p>Needs Printed</p>

			<ul>
				<li>There is a Notice template configured against the Notice Type Admin.&nbsp;</li>
				<li>The Sent Date has not been populated.&nbsp;</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Reminders Need Printed</p>

			<ul>
				<li>There is a Notice Reminder template configured against the Notice Type Admin.</li>
				<li>There is a Reminder Communication Days configured against the Notice Type Admin.&nbsp;</li>
				<li>The Sent Reminder Date has not been populated.&nbsp;</li>
				<li>The Served on Date and the number of days in the Notice Type Reminder Communication days is greater than or equal to today.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Past Due</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The Fee Required is configured against the Notice Type Admin</li>
				<li>Completed date is NULL</li>
				<li>Paid is FALSE</li>
				<li>Payment Due Date is less than or equal to TODAY</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Unpaid</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The Fee Required is configured against the Notice Type Admin</li>
				<li>Completed Date is NULL</li>
				<li>Paid is FALSE</li>
			</ul>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p><strong>Please note that the Batch Print and Batch Print Reminder functionality can be carried out in similar fashion to the specific left hand menu areas found within the Notices Module.&nbsp;</strong></p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<h1>Notice Types Admin</h1>

			<p>Much of the new functionality introduced around Notices and the new Notices Module is controlled by settings found against the specific Notice Types.&nbsp;</p>

			<p><strong>Notice Types can be configured at Admin &gt; Notices &gt; Notice Types.&nbsp;</strong></p>

			<p>When a Notice Type is being created OR an existing Notice Type is being edited, users will be presented with the following screen:</p>

			<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Notice_FILES/Notice Type Add.PNG"></p>

			<h1>Advanced Functionality - Online Payment of Fees</h1>

			<p><em><strong>Please note that this Advanced Functionality requires Tascomi to facilitate setup. If you wish to avail of the functionality outlined here please contact your product manager who can discuss this further.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Online Notice Payments</p>

			<p>The expansion of Notices into a dedicated module has allowed the team to look at further ways to improve upon and expand the available functionality. One area we have worked on was the introduction of a Notice Payment area within Council Direct.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>The idea here was to communicate a URL and PIN number or alternatively a single use QR code both of which would invite the recipient to pay any outstanding notice fee via the Council Direct portal.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Notice_FILES/pay fpn.PNG"></p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Cost Code Mapping</p>

			<p>As part of the initial configuration, Admin users will need to configure their cost code mapping. This can be done via Admin &gt; Notices &gt; Cost Code Map.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Issuing a PIN or QR code</p>

			<p>As mentioned above, the new Notices module allows users to issue Notices with either a hyperlink and PIN or simply a single use QR code so that the recipient can be directed to the Online payment area.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>The PIN and/or QR Code can be communicated via the official Notice that is sent. When creating the Communication Template for your Notices a smarty can be inserted which will populate each individual notice that is printed/emailed with a unique PIN or QR code.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>PIN Smarty:&nbsp;{$Notice-&gt;generated_pin}</p>

			<p>QR Smarty:&nbsp;&lt;img src="/images/qr_codes/{$Communication-&gt;Notice-&gt;qr_code_filename}" /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Council Direct&nbsp;</p>

			<p>When the recipient receives their link and PIN, they will be taken to the following area on Council Direct:</p>

			<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Notice_FILES/new payment pin.PNG"></p>

			<p>Once the Notice Number and PIN number are entered and the search performed the user will be taken to the following summary screen:</p>

			<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Notice_FILES/summary screen.png"></p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p>If the recipient received a QR code instead they would arrive DIRECTLY at the above summary screen.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>One here the user should complete the form as appropriate and process their payment using the relevant payment provider. Once the payment is processed the recipient will receive confirmation that the payment was successful.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Back on the Notice record within the Public Protection system, it will be marked as closed off&nbsp;with the Completed Date and the payment transaction number from the payment provider recorded as appropriate.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: The online configuration must be saved before you can set up the public visibility of documents.</p>

<p><strong>Public Documents</strong></p>

<p>The same document redaction functionality was previously implemented within the systems licensing module that provided users with the ability to redact/censor documents where appropriate before sharing the document via the public portal.</p>

<p>This will enable users to publish files on the online portal whilst redacting certain sensitive information from public view.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How to redact a document and share it via the Public Portal&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. Upload document via the Uploaded Files left hand menu.&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. Once the document has been uploaded successfully, the file will then be present within the online details area as shown below. The user would then select the 'Redact' button for the relevant file.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Notice_FILES/RedactButton.JPG"></p>

<p>3. The Redaction Tool will be loaded in a new tab within your browser.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Notice_FILES/redactionTool.JPG"></p>

<p>Point and click on the document to start redacting information. Information should be redacted line by line. Clicking once will indicate the start of the redaction line, and clicking again on the horizontal axis will mark the end of the redaction line.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Notice_FILES/redaction1.JPG"></p>

<p>Users will note some additional functionality found within the redaction screen which functions as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Hide/Show Redaction - Click between hiding and showing the information displayed underneath the redaction lines.</li>
	<li>Redact - Click to enable the Redaction tool to begin redacting information.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Redact Slider - Slide to increase/decrease the size of the redaction tool.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Arrows - Click to move the document position within the tab.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Plus/Minus Sign - Click to Zoom in and Out</li>
	<li>Rotate Sign - Click to rotate the document.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Undo - Undo last change</li>
	<li>Redo - Redo last undone change.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Clear - Clears all redaction lines from document.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Save - Saves the document with applied changes.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Layers - Will allow users to remove redaction lines individually.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>4. When the relevant areas of the file have been redacted/censored the user must then select the 'Save' option. A green banner will appear temporarily to confirm the save was successful. Once this is confirmed, the tab can be closed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>5. Reviewing the file within the Online Details configuration&nbsp;area you will now see a small icon of the Redacted document beside the redact button. The icon can be clicked in order to download a copy of the redacted document.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Notice_FILES/redactedDoc1.JPG"></p>

<p>Provided that the Online Details are configured for live, clicking the Public checkbox will ready the redacted document for sharing via the portal.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: All documents saved in the Uploaded Files left hand menu will appear here to share on the public portal. For those that have not previously been redacted the above redaction process would be used.</p>

<p>If a document&nbsp;is acceptable to share on the public portal without redaction, then the Bypass checkbox should be ticked as appropriate.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Notice_FILES/ByPass.JPG"></p>

<p>Upon completing the above steps the end user would then ensure the 'Publish Uploads' checkbox has been selected followed by saving the changes made to the online details configuration for the notice record.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The following section will introduce users to the new Prosecution Module. The module functions just like any other, offering a dedicated space for these records to live, along with associated search, view, create and saved search areas.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Prosecution_FILES/overview.PNG"></p>

<h1>View Prosecutions</h1>

<p>The View Prosecutions left hand menu, allows users to view all prosecution records available in the system. These are ordered by creation date and will display various detail related to the record.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Prosecution_FILES/view.PNG"></p>

<p>In addition, we have added an add button at bottom of the screen, if users wish to add a new prosecution record.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Search Prosecutions</h1>

<p>The Search Prosecutions left hand menu allows users to search prosecution records based on custom criteria.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Prosecution_FILES/search.PNG"></p>

<p>Following a search, results will be displayed accordingly. Records can be opened by clicking on the returned row.&nbsp;Users can also export their results to Word or Excel as appropriate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Save Search</p>

<p>If a user regularly runs a specific query they can save the search criteria. Simply populate the search fields as appropriate and click the save search button.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Prosecution_FILES/save.PNG"></p>

<p>Once a Name and Description has been defined, the search will be added to the Saved Searches left hand menu for future use.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Saved Searches</h1>

<p>Here, users will find any previously saved searches. The saved searches are unique to the individual user and as such can be added and deleted by the user as appropriate.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Create Prosecution Record</h1>

<p>By clicking the Create Prosecution left hand menu option, users can add a new prosecution record to the system. From here, the record can be linked to a parent record as appropriate. This is essentially doing the reverse of what users are perhaps used to, when adding a prosecution from the prosecution left hand menu on a licence or premises record for example.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please note, this screen can also be accessed via the "Add" button found on the "View Prosecutions" left hand menu.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Editing a Service Request</h1>

<p>Users can manage and/or edit a service request simply by clicking on the appropriate service request, Doing so will load the Service Request overview screen and the associated Left Hand Menu options.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/SRGuide_FILES/Screenshot_060117_112241_AM.jpg"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>From here users can update the appropriate fields and/or add&nbsp;manage the Service Request using the various Left Hand Menu options(communication, inspection etc).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Users should note that immediately after a Service Request is created the Core Function, Request Code and Request Category can be edited. However, as soon as an associated action is carried out against the Service Request which adds an entry against the left hand menu (communication, inspection etc), then these two fields will become locked and users will be prevented from editing them. The ability to edit this information after this point can be controlled in the users setup. Further information concerning this can be found in our&nbsp;Creating and Managing Users section.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/SRGuide_FILES/Screenshot_060117_114030_AM.jpg"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>The Service Request module allows the user to record request for service &amp; complaints calls in relation to premises, addresses and contact records. All types of service requests can be recorded and the type of request is controlled via a coded list separated by departmental functional areas.</p>

<p>Selecting this option presents the user with a list of all existing service request records:</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/SRGuide_FILES/PP5.jpg"></p>

<h1>View Requests &amp; Left Hand Menu Options</h1>

<p><strong>View Requests</strong></p>

<p>Selecting the 'View Request' option presents the user with a list of all current Requests held within the system, regardless of their status. Each can be accessed individually by clicking the desired record. This view is the same view shown to the user when first clicking the Requests module icon from the icon list.</p>

<p><strong>Left Hand Menu Options</strong></p>

<p>When a user views a Service Request record, a left hand menu appears called Request Details which displays a list of standard options e.g. Actions, Communications. In addition to the standard options, an option called 'History' if clicked, displays all previous Service Requests that are linked to the premise or location.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Search Requests</h1>

<p>The ‘Search Requests’ option on the left hand menu allows the user to find request records based on a desired search criteria. The search functionality for Service Requests is consistent with other module searches.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Selecting this option presents the user with the following screen:</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/SRGuide_FILES/PP6.jpg"></p>

<p>Users can enter as little or as much information as required to complete their search of Service Requests, before clicking the 'Search' button to return matching results. To start a new search, clicking 'Clear all data' removes previously entered search criteria.</p>

<p>The results of the search can be printed via the browser using the &lt;Control&gt; and &lt;P&gt; keys, or they can be exported to MS Excel or MS Word using the corresponding buttons.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Batch Update</h1>

<p>Once the information has been completed, pressing the 'Save' button creates the request record and allocates the unique reference number.</p>

<p>The ‘Batch Update’ option is used when updating a batch of service requests and provides a simple mechanism of finding request records which the user can then open and update the details. The Batch Update functionality for Service Requests works consistent as with other module area's batch features (covered previously).</p>

<p>Selecting this option presents the user with a simplified search screen.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/SRGuide_FILES/79.png"></p>

<p>After entering the required criteria, clicking on 'Search' executes the search and displays matching results.</p>

<p>The user can click on the required service request record to update and clicking the 'close' button returns them to the search results for further updates to be carried out as applicable.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>How to Create a Service Request</h1>

<p>The Create Requests option allows the user to add new Service Request records. When selecting this option the user is presented with the following screen:</p>

<h1>CAS - SRS ONLY</h1>

<p>Good Morning All</p>

<p>We have recently introduced some improvements around the CAS&nbsp;Web Form and associated functionality.&nbsp;Details of these changes can be found below:</p>

<p>PP-613, PP-614&nbsp;- Service Requests with the Public Health core function can now be submitted via the CAS Webform. This is in addition to the already available Environmental Protection core function.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/SRGuide_FILES/Capture.PNG"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Users will notice that both domestic and commercial complaint types are now also defined for ease of reference.&nbsp;The request codes presented in the drop-down box will be grouped based on which complaint type they fall under.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Set-up for request codes can be dictated in Admin &gt; Service Requests &gt; Complaint Codes.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/SRGuide_FILES/Screenshot_081717_014436_PM.jpg"></p>

<p>When an Environmental Protection or Public Health Complaint Code is selected users will notice a CAS Online Section appears at the bottom of the form.&nbsp;</p>

<table class="table table-bordered" style="height:57px; width:730px">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td style="width:188.5px"><strong>CAS Online Section&nbsp;</strong></td>

		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>PP-617, PP-737 -&nbsp;When an action is submitted via the CAS Web Form, both the officer responsible and a designated Out Of Hours Officer will be notified of this and an action created for them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Users will first need to define who the designated Out Of Hours officer should be. This can be set in their User Profile by checking the necessary box.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/SRGuide_FILES/Screenshot_082317_120333_PM.jpg"></p>

<p><em>Please note, that only one OOH CAS Officer can be assigned at any one time. Checking this box on one users profile, will automatically remove this from the last assigned officer. A warning message will display to remind users of this.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><em><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/SRGuide_FILES/Screenshot_082317_120837_PM.jpg"></em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>PP-618, PP-734 - Improvements have been made around the search functionality on the CAS Webform. Now when users wish to search for a request they will notice that the search fields are no longer case sensitive.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/SRGuide_FILES/Screenshot_082317_110245_AM.jpg"></p>

<p>Additionally we have added a clear form button which will clear all fields of any search criteria entered.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PP-619 - Now when creating a request via the CAS Webform, both complainant and alleged offender details can be searched for on the Gazetteer.</p>

<p>The complainant address can be searched and verified against the LLPG and the alleged offender address searched against the LLPG.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/SRGuide_FILES/Screenshot_082317_111447_AM.jpg"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>PP-735 - Please note that Offender Details under Regulatory Emergency Call are no longer required fields. It was brought to our attention that these details may not be known on every occasion.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/SRGuide_FILES/Screenshot_082317_112040_AM.jpg"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>PP-739 -&nbsp;When a Web Form submitted request is pending on the PP system, it can be transferred to another request (if for example, the request has already been submitted via a different means).&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/SRGuide_FILES/Screenshot_082317_112714_AM.jpg"></p>

<p>When users are prompted to enter the required information to initiate the transfer, it is no longer possible to accidentally provide the source request's request number.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If this number is inserted, users will receive a warning message advising that the request cannot be transferred to itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each Service Request &nbsp;displays with basic data including whether it relates to premises, location, licence or contact. If it relates to more than one of these then it says 'Multiple Locations associated to this request'.</p>

<p>To view these, users can click on edit - pencil symbol&nbsp;<img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/SROffline_FILES/pencil.png" style="height:29px; width:36px">&nbsp;which brings them into the full view of the Service Request. Note that users cannot edit&nbsp;requester, location, contact or licence in the mobile screen. This can only be done on the desktop system.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If users click on the person symbol &nbsp;<img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/SROffline_FILES/mobilePP10.png">&nbsp; on the right hand side of the Service Request details then this shows the Service Request contact details .</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/SROffline_FILES/mobilePP11.png"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Clicking on the 3 dot symbol&nbsp;<img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/SROffline_FILES/dots.png" style="height:30px; width:54px">&nbsp;on the right hand side of the service request details gives more menu options &nbsp;(like a shorter version of the the left hand menu) &nbsp;as on screenshot below.The arrow on the right hand side&nbsp;<img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/SROffline_FILES/mobilePP8.png" style="height:27px; width:47px">&nbsp;takes the user back to main Service Request &nbsp;screen and the circular sign &nbsp;<img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/SROffline_FILES/mobilePP9.png">&nbsp;removes the Service Request from the device.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/SROffline_FILES/mobilePP5.png"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example; If a user selects 'Actions' here it takes them to the actions on that service request.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/SROffline_FILES/mobilePP6.png"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the user is on an action and they click on the pencil image on the right hand side, then this brings them into the 'edit action' window.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/SROffline_FILES/MobilePP14.png"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The green circle with 3 lines at bottom right hand side of screen is the menu button and varies depending on which page the user is on.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/SROffline_FILES/MobilePP13.png"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the above screen when the user clicks on the green menu circle, then it expands to show an image of a white outline of a screen which when clicked on brings the user back to the desktop home screen or if user clicks on arrow symbol above that then it logs them out. If user clicks on the 3 lines in green circle menu symbol then it minimises the menu symbol again.</p>

<p>If the user clicks on the edit button<img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/SROffline_FILES/pencil.png" style="height:39px; width:49px">&nbsp;to the right of the service request and then clicks on the green menu circle on bottom right of screen, they then have access to the main menu (equivalent to left hand menu on desktop) See screenshot below</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Users can also access uploaded files through the main menu.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/SROffline_FILES/mobilePPupload1.png"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The File Uploader option (See screenshot below) is only on this menu and allows users to upload files from their mobile device. The only types of files that can be uploaded directly on the device are photos. There is a limit of 5 photos before the user needs to sync. &nbsp;The uploaded files can be viewed from the desktop Service Request when user has internet connection on the mobile device but cannot be viewed if offline.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/SROffline_FILES/MobilePPuploader.png"></p>

<p>The Initiatives module allows the user to view and carry out bulk mailing initiatives. For Example -an alert on product types, or a survey of particular premises such as a butchers. Selecting this option the user is presented with a list of existing initiative records, which can be viewed. Clicking a record entry in the list allows the user to view/update the details.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Initiatives_FILES/80.png"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>View Initiatives</h1>

<p>The ‘View Initiatives’ option is the default option that is displayed when selecting the Initiatives module. This displays a list of all existing Initiative records allowing the user to interact as required. After viewing a record the user can return to the list either by clicking on ‘Close’ or choosing the ‘View Initiatives’ menu option.</p>

<h1>Search Initiatives</h1>

<p>The ‘Search Initiatives’ option on the left hand menu allows the user to find Initiative records based on desired search criteria. The search functionality here is consistent with that across other modules within the system.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Selecting this option presents the user with the following screen:</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Initiatives_FILES/81.png">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Users can enter as little or as much information on the Initiative search screen followed by clicking the ‘Search’ button to return matching results. To start a new search, clicking ‘Clear all data’ removes previously entered search criteria from all fields.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The results of the search can be printed via the browser using &lt;Control&gt; and &lt;P&gt; keys or exported to MS Excel or MS Word using the corresponding buttons.</p>

<h1>Initiatives</h1>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>The Initiative module, allows end users to add and carry out new mailing Initiative activities. Users can target selected Premises, Locations and Licences as appropriate and issue letters to these in batch.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Create Initiative Type</strong></p>

<p>To begin, users will need to create an Initiative Type. This is entirely customisable, however some examples may include "Advisory Campaign", "Advisory Campaign with Inspection" or "Self Assessment Questionnaire".&nbsp;</p>

<p>To create an Initiative Type, simply navigate to Admin &gt; Initiatives &gt; Initiative Types and then select Create Type from the left hand menu.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Initiatives_FILES/Screenshot_090318_034700_PM.jpg"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<table class="table table-bordered" style="width:707px">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td style="width:199px"><strong>Field</strong></td>
			<td style="width:523px"><strong>Description</strong></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="width:199px">Initiative Type Code</td>
			<td style="width:523px">Define a short code which can be used to easily identify the Initiative Type from drop down lists.&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="width:199px">Initiative Type Description</td>
			<td style="width:523px">Enter a short description for the Initiative Type.&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="width:199px">Inspection Required</td>
			<td style="width:523px">Check this box if an inspection is required against the Initiative Type. Additional inspection related fields will be added to records associated to the initiative (see below).&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="width:199px">Enable Initiative Type</td>
			<td style="width:523px">Check this box to enable the Initiative Type for use.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once the above fields have been defined as appropriate, remember to click Submit in order to save your changes.&nbsp;All Initiative Types can be selected and edited, simply by selecting it from the list types left hand menu option.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Create Initiative Template</strong></p>

<p>Now that we have our initiative types set up, let us look at creating a template that we can use when batch generating letters as part of the initiative.</p>

<p>To create an Initiative Template, simply navigate to Admin &gt; Initiatives &gt; Initiative Templates and then select Create Template from the left hand menu.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Initiatives_FILES/Screenshot_090318_042915_PM.jpg"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<table class="table table-bordered" style="height:93px; width:864px">

			<td style="width:429px"><strong>Description</strong></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="width:428px">Initiative Template Name</td>
			<td style="width:429px">Define the name for the Initiative Template. This will be displayed in drop down fields.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="width:428px">Initiative Type</td>
			<td style="width:429px">Select an initiative type (see previous section).&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="width:428px">Use Communication Template</td>
			<td style="width:429px">Check this box to use a template already set up in communications as your Initiative Template. Please note, this is the ONLY way to use a WebDav based template. Initiative Templates created without this checkbox ticked will be editor based letters.&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>Any initiatives created (that are not using a WebDav based communication template can be edited by clicking on the edit button associated to the template.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Initiatives_FILES/Screenshot_090418_010110_PM.jpg">&nbsp;</p>

<p>This will open the initiative template in the CK editor tool where it can be created/edited as desired.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Create Initiative Results</strong></p>

<p>Lastly users should define Initiative Results. Each time an initiative is created against a record, the result/outcome of the initiative can be recorded. The options available are driven by the options created in Admin &gt; Initiatives &gt; Create Result</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Initiatives_FILES/Screenshot_090418_123110_PM.jpg"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All Initiative Results can be selected and edited, simply by selecting it from the list results left hand menu option.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Create Initiatives</strong></p>

<p>Now that we have set up the basic admin required for our initiatives to function correctly, we can now go about creating an initiative for use in the system.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Users should navigate to Initiatives &gt; Create Initiatives to begin. Users will be presented with the following screen:</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Initiatives_FILES/Screenshot_090318_033918_PM.jpg"></p>

<p>When creating new mailing initiatives, the user is prompted to enter the following fields:</p>

<table class="table table-bordered" style="width:649px">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td style="width:142px"><strong>Field Name</strong></td>

		<tr>
			<td style="width:142px">Required Date</td>
			<td style="width:501px">This date field allows the user to record the date that the Initiative requires a response and/or completion by (as appropriate). This can be entered manually, chosen from the calendar control or by entering 't' for a short cut to the current date.</td>

		<tr>
			<td style="width:142px">Initiative Template</td>
			<td style="width:501px">This drop down allows the user to choose the Initiative Template ( see initiatives templates and the Systems Administration Manual) to be used for the bulk mailing.</td>

			<td style="width:501px">This section allows the user to record time and/or travel that may be relevant to the Initiative. To do this, the user needs to enter the appropriate time followed by clicking on the corresponding 'Add' button.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once the information on this screen has been completed, pressing the ‘Save’ button creates the Initiative record and allocates a unique reference number.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Managing Initiaitves</strong></p>

<p>Any Initiatives that have been created can be accessed via the View Initiatives or Search Initiatives left hand menu options found in the Initiatives module. Clicking on an initiative record will open this, allowing the user to manage their initiative.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Users will notice that within the record, the left hand menu options appear&nbsp;for completion of the mailing exercise. In order to finalise the Initiative, a group of Premises, Licence and/or address Locations must be identified through searching on shared criteria. These Premises/Licences/Locations will then be selected as recipients or participants within the targeted Initiative.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Initiatives_FILES/Screenshot_090418_011723_PM.jpg"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example: If the target of the exercise are commercial Premises, the user would choose the Premise left hand option before being presented with a detailed search screen in order to identify recipients of the mailing. Suggested ways of doing this could be through Main Usage codes, legislation, machinery and foods handled relevant to the sites and Initiative subject.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The search screen is consistent with that used across the system's modules, though has the full range of criteria available for selection in order to catch as broad or narrow a selection of Premises as is required.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Initiatives_FILES/87.png"></p>

<p>By moving Premises from the left hand list to the Initiative selection list on the right hand side (using the green arrows), the results of the query can be further refined until the exact pool of recipients has been identified. Alternatively, a 'Select All' can be used when moving or the query can be re-specified as required if incorrect.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Initiatives_FILES/88.png"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the target of the exercise is a Licence or Location, the user would choose the relevant left hand option before being presented with a detailed search screen in order to identify recipients of the mailing. The search screen is consistent with that used across the system's modules in relation to Locations and Licensing.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Initiatives_FILES/89.png"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Having selected the pool of Premises/Licences/Location to use for the Initiative, the left hand menu will show tick boxes as appropriate.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Initiatives_FILES/Screenshot_090418_024800_PM.jpg"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Merge Document</strong></p>

<p>Clicking on the merge document left hand menu option will immediately begin the process of generating letters for all of the records selected in the previous step. Please note that we would recommend that all initiatives are generated per record type: that is, all premises or all licences. Multiple record types are support however would require an advanced understanding of smarty codes and else/if statements to be inserted into the template.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Merge Document - WebDav</strong></p>

<p>If a WebDav communication is being used as the source template, users will be presented with the following screen:</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Initiatives_FILES/Screenshot_090418_034548_PM.jpg"><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Initiatives_FILES/Screenshot_090418_034612_PM.jpg"></p>

<p>By default, each letter will be created based on the layout defined on the template. If a user wishes to manually edit the letter on a certain record, they can use the Word - Open buttonto load it for editing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Download Selected: Downloads in PDF all of the letters selected using the checkbox assocuated to each.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Generate/Re Generate Selected: Re-generates all of the selected letters using the default template configuration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Merge Document - Editor</strong></p>

<p>If an Editor communication is being used as the source template, users will be presented with the following screen:</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Initiatives_FILES/Screenshot_090418_035319_PM.jpg"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>An editor based document will load, with the letter template repeated per selected record. Users can manually edit records if necessary before using the print symbol in the tool bar to generate the letters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Initiatives Left Hand Menu</strong></p>

<p>When a batch of initiative letters are generated, the Associated Records &gt; Initiatives left hand menu on each record will show a tick. Clicking on this within a record will link the user back a list of any associated initiatives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please note, a copy of the letter will not be saved on a record per record basis. If necessary the batch of letters can be downloaded and saved against the Initiative record via the Uploaded Files left hand menu.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Email Document (Premise Records Only)</strong></p>

<p>Selecting the email document left hand menu option will allow users to email the letters instead of printing and posting them. Users will be presented with a similar email screen which they will be used to seeing elsewhere throughout the system.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Uploaded Files</strong></p>

<p>Here users can upload files associated to the initiative record. Functionality is identical here for file uploads across other areas of the system.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Initiatives_FILES/Screenshot_090418_042310_PM.jpg"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Initiatives Left Hand Menu (Premise and Licence records only) </strong></p>

<p>Once an initiative has been created and associated to either a Premise or a Licence, an entry will be made against each record.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To access this, users should navigate to the record they require and click on the Associated Records left hand menu, and then on Initiatives.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Initiatives_FILES/Screenshot_090618_101017_AM.jpg"></p>

<p>The first thing users till notice is a summary of the Initiative linked to the record.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Specific Licence Details: Here users can record the date an initiative letter was responded to, in addition to the result and any relevant notes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Schedule an Inspection: If the "Inspection Required" checkbox is ticked against the Initiative Type then an area will appear to allow users to schedule an associated inspection. Users should record the response date, result and notes (if appropriate) in addition to the Planned date, Activity Code, Inspection Group and Responsible Officer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once the above changes have been made, users should save their changes. If Inspection details had been entered they will appear against the parent record now.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>SMS Functionality</h1>

<p><strong>Configuring Your Initiaitve for SMS&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>In order to target contacts on an Initiative record via SMS, then the selected Initiative Template MUST be marked as an SMS Initiative.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Initiatives_FILES/Initiative template.PNG"></p>

<p>Remember, Initiative Templates are maintained via Admin &gt; Initiatives &gt; Initiative Templates. Unlike a regular initiative template, an SMS specific one should have the "Is SMS Template" option checked and the SMS Template selected from the dropdown list as appropriate.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Initiatives_FILES/SMS Init.PNG"></p>

<p>With the above configured, users should be ready to begin using their Initiative to direct SMS text messages to targeted recipients.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Sending SMS via Initiative</strong></p>

<p>In order to begin sending SMS messages, you should follow the usual steps required to complete an Initiative. Once the Initiative has been defined and the target records selected, click the Merge Document left hand menu in order to be directed to the SMS summary screen.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Initiatives_FILES/SMS Summary.PNG"></p>

<p>At first glance the above screen may seem complicated and/or intimidating however with a little guidance it should be neither.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the bottom of the page, will be a list of contact details, automatically grouped by the parent record that there were extrapolated from. The example above shows that my Initiative has targeted two premise records, and from these the system has extrapolated both an owner and occupier for each. Should these premise records also have had associated contacts, these would also have appeared here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now that we have identified the bottom half of the page, the top half can be referred back to and can be used simply to filter those contacts that you actually wish to target with an SMS text message.&nbsp;</p>

<table class="table table-bordered" style="height:251px; width:859px">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td style="width:182px"><strong>Filter</strong></td>
			<td style="width:671px"><strong>Description</strong></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="width:182px">Has Mobile Number</td>
			<td style="width:671px">Checking this will display ONLY those contacts that have a mobile number recorded against them.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="width:182px">Has No Mobile Number</td>
			<td style="width:671px">Checking this will display ONLY those contacts that do not have a mobile number recorded against them.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="width:182px">Hide Duplicate Numbers</td>
			<td style="width:671px">Checking this will hide contacts where a mobile number is duplicated on another contact (instance where owner and occupier is the same for example).&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="width:182px">Select All</td>
			<td style="width:671px">Checking this will mark ALL contacts to receive an SMS.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="width:182px">Additional Areas</td>
			<td style="width:671px">Checking each of the additional areas will mark the appropriate contact to receive an SMS. This allows the user to easily identify particular contacts (premise owner only for example).&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>

<p>The Food Poisoning module allows the user to record infectious and/or Communicable Disease incidents. Selecting this option presents the user with a list of existing records.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Food_FILES/91.png"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>View Poisonings</h1>

<p>The ‘View Poisoning’ option is the default option that is displayed when first selecting the Food Poisonings module. This displays a list of all existing records allowing the user to view/update records as required. After viewing a record, the user can return to the list either by clicking on ‘Close’ or choosing the ‘View Poisonings’ upper left hand menu option.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Search Poisonings</h1>

<p>Once the information has been completed, pressing the 'Save' button creates the record and allocates the unique reference number.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Batch Update</h1>

<p>The 'Batch Update' option is used when updating a batch of Infectious/Communicable Disease records. It provides a simple mechanism of finding relation records, following which the user can open the records (in sequence if wished) to update the details. Selecting this option presents the user with a simplified search screen:</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Food_FILES/94.png"></p>

<p>After entering the required criteria, clicking on 'Search' executes the search and displays matching results.</p>

<p>The user can click then on the required record in order to update and clicking the 'Close' button returns them to the search results screen for further updates as required.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Inspections</h1>

<p>The Inspections left hand menu option displays a list of existing inspection records in relation to the current food poisoning&nbsp;record, with the facility to add new inspections as required.</p>

<p>Please note that when looking at the inspections list, any records where the 'actual' date is blank represent outstanding inspections.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 'Print Forms' button that is displayed on the food poisoning can be used&nbsp;if the user is not updating the inspection on a mobile device or laptop.</p>

<p>The offline flag is checked on the accident manually if the user wants to update the accident form offline which is suitable for when the user has no access to the internet.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Food_FILES/accidents - LHM inspections.png"></p>

<p>Clicking the 'Add' button allows a new inspection to be created on&nbsp;the selected food poisoning&nbsp;record. When adding inspections directly from an Food Poisoning&nbsp;record the premise details linked to the food poisoning record&nbsp;will automatically be populated.</p>

<p>For more information on how to create an inspection please refer to the&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<a href="https://public-protection.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/200650882-Inspections-Guide">Inspection Guide</a></p>

<h1>Samples</h1>

<p>The Samples left hand menu displays sample records that have been added to a food poisoning&nbsp;inspection&nbsp;for updating on a food poisoning record.&nbsp;&nbsp;This section only allows users to view and update sample details. New sample records need to be added in the&nbsp;inspection module. Tascomi recommend the use of Inspections for&nbsp;creating samples as this will ensure that there is a link to both the inspection and the premise.</p>

<p>For more information on how to create a sample&nbsp;please refer to&nbsp;<a href="https://public-protection.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204133952-Add-Sample">create a sample knowledge guide</a></p>

<h1>Actions</h1>

<p>The Actions left hand menu displays existing actions in relation to the food poisoning&nbsp;record together with the ability to add new action records against the food poisoning&nbsp;record. Actions are activities involved with the monitoring of the food poisoning&nbsp;record.</p>

<p>Actions represent elements of history that have taken place together with the ability to generate future pending actions for tasks that need to be undertaken.</p>

<p>After selecting the 'Actions' left hand menu option, the user is presented with the following screen:</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Food_FILES/actions - LHM inspections.png">After choosing to Add Action, the following screen appears which automatically links the action to the food poisoning&nbsp;record&nbsp;and passes through the food poisoning&nbsp;reference number and the premises address to the action record itself:</p>

<p>We have introduced an improved map interface accompanied by new GIS functionality into the Public Protection system. The following article will review the new map interface, including details of layers, guidance on how to draw polygons and useful new features such as Street View.</p>

<p><strong>New Maps Interface</strong></p>

<p>The new maps interface will be found throughout the system including Premises, Locations, Notices and Licences and even appears in admin areas (specific to ward allocation). It should be noted that the map interface and specifically the available menu options will vary dependent upon the area of the system the map is accessed from.</p>

<p>The following article will cover the basic functionality available when using the new map interface, as will as reviewing some of the additional menu options and what they do.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Basic Overview&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Anytime a map button is clicked in the Public Protection system, the map interface will open in a new tab as follows:</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Locations_FILES/overview.PNG"></p>

<p>Users can interact with the map itself, left clicking to drag the focal point of the map and using the scroll wheel to zoom in and out. The menu options found along the top of the modal itself, will offer additional functionality as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Display</li>
	<li>Search</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's take a look below at the menu options available and what each of them allows the user to do when accessed throughout the Public Protection product.</p>

<p>Display</p>

<p>The Display option allows us to change the map interface by interchanging various layers, re-centering on the location we are working on and entering street view mode.&nbsp;</p>

<table class="table table-bordered">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Background Layer/Map</td>
			<td>
			<p>This option defines the general background layer used for the Map interface.&nbsp;The options available here will be dependent on those available to your council area or those which you may have provided to Tascomi:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>OSM</li>
			</ul>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Layers</td>
			<td>
			<p>This option allows the user to select the layers that can be added to your Map interface. The options available here will be dependent on those available to your council area or those which you may have provided to Tascomi:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Locations (displays all available locations from within the Public Protection system - clicking on a location point on the map will display additional address information in the top right hand corner of the map interface).&nbsp;</li>
			</ul>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Recentre&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Recentres the map based on the Location the map was accessed from.&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Street View</td>
			<td>Click this option to start street view. The mouse pointer will change to a crossheir:&nbsp; allowing the user to click a point on the map a which point street view will open in a new tab.&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>Search</p>

<p>The search option allows users to query the map by entering specific location details.</p>

<table class="table table-bordered">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Location Search&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Used to search various places, streets, post codes etc and move the map focus to that searched area.&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Advanced Functionality</strong></p>

<p>The new map interface offers advanced functionality. Users may already be familiar with the ability to draw polygons for the purposes of <a href="https://public-protection.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010057774-Ward-Allocation">Ward Allocation</a>, however the use of polygons has now been extended further with both Premises and Licence Modules offering a "GIS" left hand menu against their records.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>GIS Left Hand Menu</p>

<p>The GIS Left Hand Menu, allows users to plot a polygon against that record. Once the polygon has been plotted and saved, then an image is captured and stored against the front screen of the record.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Locations_FILES/premises.PNG"></p>

<p><em>Please note, that additional functionality around polygons and the GIS left hand menu will likely be introduced over the coming months and years.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Draw</p>

<p>The Draw menu is where users will be able to start drawing their polygons.</p>

<table class="table table-bordered" style="width:698px">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td style="width:82px">Polygon</td>
			<td style="width:611px">Select this to enable the ability to draw your polygon.&nbsp;To draw a polygon, left clicks will plot first (and subsequent) points of the polygon. To finish, either left click on the starting point or double click.&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="width:82px">Delete All</td>
			<td style="width:611px">Deletes all polygons added via this premises/licence record.&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>Save</p>

<p>The Save menu allows users to save drawn polygons (geometry) and images.&nbsp;</p>

<table class="table table-bordered" style="height:41px; width:697px">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td style="width:84px">Save Geometry</td>
			<td style="width:607px">Saves the polygon.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="width:84px">Save Image</td>
			<td style="width:607px">Saves the image against the application record. This may be useful if the user wishes to customise what is stored on the record ie: background, level of zoom etc.&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Neighbours Communications - New (Licence Records ONLY)</strong></p>

<p>On Licence Records, we have added some additional functionality which will allow users to query locations found within a specified polygon or radius, and subsequently target them with communications.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This may be useful for example, if occupied houses in a surrounding area, need to be consulted or advised prior to a licence being granted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Neighbours</p>

<p>The Neighbours Menu allows users to draw either a polygon or define a radius on the map, in order to interrogate which locations exist within that space. To get started click on the Neighbours menu item and the following options will appear.&nbsp;</p>

<table class="table table-bordered" style="height:49px; width:706px">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td style="width:99px"><strong>Field Name</strong></td>
			<td style="width:366px"><strong>Description</strong></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="width:99px">Polygon</td>
			<td style="width:366px">Allows user to draw a polygon on the map interface. As per the above notes,&nbsp;left clicks will plot first (and subsequent) points of the polygon. To finish, either left click on the starting point or double click.&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="width:99px">Radius</td>
			<td style="width:366px">Allows user to draw a circle on the map. The first point clicked on the map will act as the centre point. Moving the cursor in either direction will expand the radius from that point. Clicking again will lock the radius in.&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Locations_FILES/radius.PNG"></p>

<p>The above screenshot shows a radius which has been defined just outside of Dungannon town centre.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once either a polygon or radius has been defined, a list of locations, based on your official address dataset (that is official locations and non official locations which exist in our database and have BOTH an x and y co-ordinate), will be displayed toward the upper right hand corner of the map interface.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Locations_FILES/locations.PNG"></p>

<p>The Check/Uncheck All checkbox can be used to select/deselect all locations as appropriate, or alternatively the required locations can be selected individually.&nbsp;</p>

<table class="table table-bordered" style="height:46px; width:710px">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td style="width:215px"><strong>Field Name</strong></td>
			<td style="width:489px"><strong>Description</strong></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="width:215px">Generate Communication</td>
			<td style="width:489px">Clicking this option will take the selected locations, and navigate the user to a create communication screen, where the selected locations will appear in the communication to area.&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>&nbsp;<img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Locations_FILES/comm to.PNG"></p>

<p>Once the communication is generated, it will appear similarly to other batch created communications. For further details, please see our dedicated help centre article on batch create communications.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Associated Records</h1>

<p>When viewing a locations record, users can also click on 'Associated Records' on the left hand menu to view any records that are also associated with this location. In the example below, there are 2 premises records associated with this location.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Locations_FILES/associated.png" style="height:288px; width:783px"></p>

<h1>Ward &amp; Parish Codes</h1>

<p>Certain Councils have requested that the fields of Ward Codes and Parish Codes are available to use in address fields. If a council has this system functionality then the users can choose whether to activate it or not by using a check box in the 'Edit User' screen</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Locations_FILES/wards.png" style="height:292px; width:784px"></p>

<p>Once activated then the codes are shown as both a display field and a searchable field thoughout the PP system. They can be searched anywhere that 'Search address' is available.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Locations_FILES/ward.png" style="height:371px; width:757px"></p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Locations are addresses which are populated via the Organisation's LLPG. Location records are used throughout the system to link through Premises, Service Requests, Domestics and Contact records. There is one set of location records and individual records may be used across multiple parts of the system. DTF transfers help manage the updating of location/address records. The term ‘DTF’ refers to the ‘Data Transfer Format’ which is used when populating or updating the address database upon such change requests.</p>

<h1>Search Locations</h1>

<p>Choosing the 'Locations' option from the top menu bar of the screen automatically presents the user with the search options by default. The search screen allows the user to find address records within the system.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Locations_FILES/95.png"></p>

<p>The Search Locations screen includes the fields stored in relation to the organisation's property gazetteer. The specific gazetteer options are displayed on the right hand side of the screen.</p>

<p>When searching for a Location, the user can enter as few fields or as little content as required. The more content that is entered, the more results will be returned. This is consistent with all other searching within the system.</p>

<p><strong>Please note that the 'Non DTF' checkbox will return records that did not come via the DTF load. This will primarily include records that have been added manually.</strong></p>

<p>Once criteria have been entered, clicking on the 'Search' option displays the results for selection and further interrogation. This allows users to click on a record to view or update.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When selecting an item from the list to view any records that have been loaded from the corporate gazetteer will be displayed as read only and cannot be updated. If there are known or discovered problems with address content, this needs to be updated via the gazetteer and subsequent DTF updates instead.</p>

<p>The View screen includes a tab which displays associated premises and GIS information. Address records that have been created manually can be updated via this screen by users with the appropriate security permissions:</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Locations_FILES/96.png"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Create Locations for Addresses outside area(When non-LLPG (non-DTF) Locations</h1>

<p>There are times where the ability to pin records of numerous types (Requests, Contacts) to addresses that are not within the&nbsp;solution's official LLPG database is advantageous to Users.<br>
For example -&nbsp; a flytipping complaint on a stretch of road just outside of a Council's Boundary<br>
but which is on a shared road from one LA to another or a mobile street trader from another area or any alternative scenario where an LLPG address&nbsp;is not currently available.</p>

<p>Step 1 - Create Street Record<br>
Initial step will be to create a new Street Record (assuming here there isn't one already that the User wishes to use -&nbsp;if so, this step can be skipped)</p>

<p>from Locations&gt;Create Street. Enter the mandatory fields including the&nbsp;Internal Street Reference and any others deemed necessary ensuring you save the record; note that you can return&nbsp;and complete edits later. The internal street reference must be a unique reference. Eg: "Non County vehicle Reg 123"</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Locations_FILES/street.png"></p>

<p>Step 2 - Create Location Record (search Street Internal Reference)</p>

<p>Using Locations&gt;Create Location locate your Street Record with the Internal Reference that will be shared between&nbsp;the two.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Locations_FILES/street2.png"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Step 3 - Location Add (now Street has been selected)</p>

<p>From within the new Location Record, populate required fields as necessary including accurate Grid References if&nbsp;you want the map functionality later on, ensuring you save the new record.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Locations_FILES/street3.png"></p>

<p>Step 4 - Confirm Details (Search Locations using Non-DTF only flag)</p>

<p>Returning to Locations&gt;Search Locations find your new Location Record; using the shared Internal Reference and&nbsp;Non-DTF only flag will cut down results trawl.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Locations_FILES/street4.png"></p>

<p>Step 5 - To Use as Location subject of Service Request (search as Step 4)</p>

<p>Create a new Service Request at Service Requests&gt;Create Request and fill in details basing the complaint on&nbsp;'Location' not Premises, Contact or License. EP as Core Function and appropriate Request Code is required to for example generate the additional flytipping fields.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Locations_FILES/street5.png"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please remember that your created Street and Location records can continually be revised and updated to be more&nbsp;accurate/complete as needed - changes made will be reflected in all associated records.<br>
It should also be noted that these created addresses can be merged into other records should an alternative (officialor not) be preferred.</p>

<h1>Geographical Information System (GIS)</h1>

<p>After selecting a location record, either via the locations option or within an associated record, the user also has access to view the address on a Map using the BLPU/Grid Coordinates.</p>

<p>After selecting a location record the GIS button appears as the third tab which then displays the location of the current address using standard base map layers. The current location is represented by the blue ‘kite’ symbol.</p>

<p>When viewing a Location record, the ‘Map’ button is displayed below the address details once an address is selected.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Locations_FILES/99.png"></p>

<p>The Map window includes the following features:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Panning&nbsp;</strong>- The panning options are displayed as a set of arrows and allow the user to move the map up, down, left or right (North, South, West and East as per typical map orientation) by clicking.</li>
	<li><strong>Zooming</strong> - The zoom facility by default is set on the minimum zoom extent. This can be changed either by clicking on the + (zoom in) or - (zoom out) symbols on the scale bar, or by clicking on the required zoom level (increments) on the scale bar itself.</li>
	<li><strong>Layers</strong> - The + button on the top right displays the configured layers for the Organisation, which may come from a corporate GIS or exist as standalone files. By default the layers displayed are from Open Street Map (OSM). Users can choose a different layer by selecting the relevant option from this box.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Merge Locations</h1>

<p>The Merge Locations option available from the left hand menu of the Locations section has been modified to restrict the pool of premises that can be merged. This prevents records that were created via the gazetteer to only be used as Primary merge records. Secondary merge records (which are subsequently deleted following the merge) can only be records that were created manually and did not originate from DTF.</p>

<p>To merge a location the user initially needs to carry out a search using the Location Search functionality to locate any duplicates. Once the records are determined, the user can merge the temporary (Non-DTF) record which will transfer related data to the new (LLPG) record.</p>

<p>To merge a record, the user needs to click the ‘Source’ option on ONE record which will be retained and choose the ‘Merge’ option on records that will be moved to the source record and which will then be subsequently deleted.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Locations_FILES/100.png"></p>

<p>Following selection of these elements, clicking the 'Merge' button completes the process.</p>

<h1>Inspections</h1>

<p>The Inspections left hand menu option allows users to create records of different types of ad-hoc inspections for a selected Grant.&nbsp;On selecting a Grant&nbsp;record, the types of inspections that can be generated will be dependent on the functional areas that have been registered against the Grant.</p>

<p>To learn more about inspections please check out our inspections help centre area&nbsp;<a href="https://public-protection.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/115000230849-Inspections-Guide">here</a>.</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>The Grants module allows users to record, monitor, review, approve or cancel Housing Grant applications. When selecting this option the user is presented with the search screen by default, which can be used to find specific grant records. This varies from the typical 'View...' screen which is displayed in other modules. Alternatively the ‘View Grants’ option in the top left hand menu will display a list of Grant records.</p>

<h1>View Grants</h1>

<p>The ‘View Grants’ top left hand menu option displays a list of all existing Grant records, allowing the user to view/update records as required by clicking on the corresponding record entry.</p>

<p>To again return to the list of Grant records, the user can once more click the ‘View Grants’ option from the left hand menu.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Grants_FILES/106.png"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>View Cancelled</h1>

<p>The ‘View Cancelled’ option displays a list of Grant records that have been cancelled at some stage of their lifecycle. Only users with relevant security permissions have the ability to cancel Grant records.</p>

<h1>Search Grants</h1>

<p>The ‘Search Grants’ option on the left hand menu allows the user to find Grant records based on desired search criteria. This is the same option that appears when initially choosing the ‘Grants’ option from the top icon menu.</p>

<p>Selecting this option presents the user with the following screen:</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Grants_FILES/107.png"></p>

<p>Users can enter as little or as much information on the Grant Search screen followed by clicking the ‘Search’ button to return matching results. To start a new search, clicking ‘Clear all data’ removes previously entered search criteria. Please note that by default <u>Cancelled records are not included in the search</u> but this can be modified on command by altering the value in the ‘Cancelled’ drop down. <strong>In addition, users should note that this Yes/No dropdown searches ONLY against the 'Grant Cancelled' tick box within the Grant record. Any Statuses of 'Cancelled' or similar should be queried using the 'Status' multi-select search field.</strong></p>

<p>The results of the search can be printed via the browser shortcut of &lt;Control&gt; and &lt;P&gt; keys. Users can click on items returned by the search to view/update the corresponding record.</p>

<h1>Create Grant</h1>

<p>The Create Grant option allows the user to add new Grant records to the system. When selecting this option the user is presented with the following screen, which is the main Grant details entry screen. Once the Grant record has been initially created the user is then able to record additional information related to the Grant using the appropriate left hand menu items.</p>

<p>The Grant landing page will be split into different sections. When creating the Grant the user is prompted to enter the following fields:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Prerequisites</h1>

<p>The ‘Prerequisites’ tab displays a list of the configured standard pre-requisites that need to be carried out prior to the Grant being approved. The list of pre-requisites displayed is dependent on the Grant type selected and its specific configuration -&nbsp;Guidance on Grant Type configuration can be found <a href="https://public-protection.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205594602-Creating-and-Managing-Grant-Types" style="background-color: #ffffff;">here.</a></p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Grants_FILES/GrantPrerequisites.JPG">Users can update each pre-requisite with a ‘Completed’ date and Officer when the requirement has been completed. In addition there is an optional expiry date for pre-requisites which only last for a period of time. Please note that the mandatory flag indicates a pre-requisite that must be completed and the Target Date is calculated automatically based on pre-requisites configuration against the Grant Type in Admin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When updating the pre-requisites, the user is prompted to enter the following fields:</p>

<table class="table table-bordered">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><strong>Type</strong></td>
			<td>This display only field shows the pre-requisite for the Grant Application. This can be changed if required via System Administration.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><strong>Create Note</strong></td>
			<td>When selected this presents a free text field allowing users to store individual notes against each pre-requisite.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><strong>Completed Date</strong></td>
			<td>This date field allows the user to enter the date the pre-requisite was completed. This can be entered manually, chosen from the calendar control or by entering 't' for a shortcut to the current date.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><strong>Expiry Date</strong></td>
			<td>This date field allows the user to enter the date the pre-requisite is to expire. This can be entered manually, chosen from the calendar control or by entering 't' for a shortcut to the current date. When a pre requisite expires the responsible officer will be notified.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><strong>Officer</strong></td>
			<td>This drop down code list allows the user to choose the officer responsible for the pre-requisite for the licence application.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><strong>Mandatory</strong></td>
			<td>This display only field shows whether this pre-requisite is mandatory and therefore&nbsp;<strong>must be completed before the application can be approved</strong>. This can be changed if required via System Administration.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><strong>Target Date</strong></td>
			<td>
			<p>This display only field shows the target date for the pre-requisite. This is set by the system and can be changed if required via System Administration.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>After updating the pre-requisite details pressing save ensures that the records are updated.</p>

<p><strong>Create Duplicate Pre-requisites</strong></p>

<p>Once one or more pre-requisites have been added to&nbsp;a licence record, a duplicate can be added if necessary by clicking the + button located beside a pre-requisite.</p>

<p>Once the + button is clicked, a duplicate pre-requisite will appear immediately next on the list. It will be duplicated exactly per the parent pre-requisite, with the user simply having to enter the completed date and expiry date as appropriate:</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Grants_FILES/duplicatePre.JPG"></p>

<p>The - button can be used if necessary to remove a duplicate pre-requisite if it is added in error.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Add Notes</strong></p>

<p>Users have the ability to add notes to each of the pre-requisites listed on the Grant record by clicking the Create Note button.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Grants_FILES/CreateNote.JPG"></p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Grants_FILES/testNote.JPG"></p>

<p>Once the note has been entered the user will need to select the 'Save' button to ensure the amendment is stored successfully.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Any pre-requisites with a note stored against them will be obvious from the Show Note indicator:</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Grants_FILES/showNote.JPG"></p>

<h1>View Grant (LHM)</h1>

<p>The ‘View Grant’ left hand menu option allows the user to return to the summary details of the Grant record. This option is useful when viewing one of the other left hand menu options and returns the user from any sub-areas to the Grant record itself.</p>

<h1>Grant Adaptations</h1>

<p>The ‘Grant Adaptations’ left hand menu option allows the user to record additional information associated with any adaptation works required as part of a Grant.</p>

<h1>Schedule of Work</h1>

<p>This section allows the user to enter the Schedule of Work for the Grant record. The schedule utilises standard paragraphs with standard values, both of which can be modified if required within System Administration. As well as entering different schedule items the user is able to change the quantity and value of each items added to the schedule. On selecting this left hand menu option the user is presented with the following screen:</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Grants_FILES/111.png"></p>

<p>Please note that a schedule cannot be created once the ‘ready for approval’ has been checked on the main Grant screen.</p>

<p>To enter a schedule item, users can choose the desired schedule of work code/name from the drop down list.&nbsp; Clicking the 'Add' button will create the schedule.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Grants_FILES/112.png"></p>

<p>After choosing a schedule item, the user can update the quantity, rate and notes as required. Any changes made to the quantity on the schedule items will automatically calculate the schedule cost and total cost.&nbsp; This process can be repeated for all schedule items required for the Grant application.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Grants_FILES/113.png"></p>

<p>Clicking the 'Remove' button will delete unwanted schedule items from the list. Clicking the 'Sort' button allows the user to move the schedule items into a different display order if required.</p>

<p>When all schedule items have been entered or required changes made, clicking the 'Save' button adds the schedule items/changes to the Grant record.</p>

<h1>Costs Returned</h1>

<p>This left hand menu option allows the user to record the cost information returned in relation to the Grant Schedule of Work entered in the previous section. These take the form of quotations from builders/contractors interested in the planned work. Please note that the total for each of the sections is displayed in relation to each schedule.</p>

<p>When selecting this option, the user is presented with the following screen:</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Grants_FILES/114.png"></p>

<p>A summary of each of the separate schedules is displayed at the top of each section. To view the full schedule item text the user can click the corresponding ‘Hide/Show Details’ button to toggle. Clicking this button again suppresses the text.</p>

<p>To add a Returned Cost the user needs to click the ‘Search’ button in relation to the relevant schedule item. This presents the user with a Contact search which can then be used to find the desired builder/contractor entry. Depending on the System Administration setup, a group or pool of entries may be pre-selected already within the search interface, for Contacts who are associated with Grants work. Once a Contact has been selected the user will need to enter the estimate and applicable VAT rate from the drop down followed by clicking the ‘Add’ button. This process can be repeated for multiple Contact's quotations in relation to each of the schedule items. Items can be removed if entered in error by clicking the corresponding ‘Delete’ button.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Grants_FILES/115.png"></p>

<p>Once the builder/contractor has been chosen, clicking on the ‘Selected’ button prompts the user to confirm the approved amount (which defaults to the Contact's estimate - if required the user can override this value) marking this Contact and their quote as valid for the subsequent Grant work.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Grants_FILES/116.png"></p>

<p>The selected cost will highlight the corresponding row with a white background to ensure that it stands out from the quotation costs listed. At the bottom of the screen a summary of the schedules are displayed together with the cost and selected builder/contractor.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Grants_FILES/117.png"></p>

<p>The Dogs section allows the user to create records relating to lost/found dogs incidents reported. Initially the record raised may relate to a lost dog which can later be progressed as an enquiry, with added information recorded relating to the owner when found/applicable.</p>

<p>Selecting this menu option presents the user with a list of existing Dog records. Users can choose to sort the columns as required and clicking on a record allows them to view the dog record together with related information.</p>

<h1>My Dogs</h1>

<p>We have added a new left hand menu to the Dogs Module called My Dogs.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Dog_FILES/Screenshot_061918_025141_PM.jpg"></p>

<p>Dog records that display here will be those records where the signed in user is marked as the Dog Warden/Officer responsible.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>View Dogs</h1>

<p>Selecting the ‘View Dogs’ option presents the user with a list of all dog records, which is the same viewing option that is presented when first choosing the Dogs menu option from the top interface bar.</p>

<h1>Search Dogs</h1>

<p>The ‘Search Dogs’ option allows the user to find dog records by filling in the required search criteria. After entering search criteria, clicking ‘search’ displays the matching results. Search functionality in Dogs is consistent will all other record processing areas of the system.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Dog_FILES/129.png"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Create Dogs</h1>

<p>The ‘Create Dogs’ option allows the user to create new Dog case records. Tascomi would recommend using the search option initially to ensure that the record has not already been created prior to adding a new record.</p>

<p>Choosing the create option, presents the user with the following screen:</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Dog_FILES/Create Dogs.PNG"></p>

<h1>Online Details and Stray Dog Register</h1>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>We have added additional functionality to the Dogs Module to allow users to push details on a record by record basis to an Online Dogs Register. The Online Dogs Register will be available via your Council Direct portal and had been designed to display detail relevant to Stray Dogs.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Configuration</strong></p>

<p>Please note that the Stray Dogs Register is enabled/disabled by Tascomi so any queries concerning availability of the register should be directed to Support. In addition, entries on the register are configured on a record by record basis.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Online Details Left Hand Menu</strong></p>

<p>To begin configuring a Dogs record to display on the register, users should navigate to the Online Details left hand menu and click Add.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Dog_FILES/Add Online.PNG"></p>

<table class="table table-bordered" style="height:170px; width:558px">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td style="width:182px"><strong>Field</strong></td>
			<td style="width:353px"><strong>Description</strong></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="width:182px">Public From</td>
			<td style="width:353px">The earliest date that this record will be shown on the Public Portal (provided that the Live checkbox is also ticked).&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="width:182px">Public To</td>
			<td style="width:353px">
			<p>The latest date that this record will be shown on the Public Portal (provided that the Live checkbox is also ticked).</p>

			<p><strong>Note</strong>: If left blank, this record will indefinitely remain public.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="width:182px">Live</td>
			<td style="width:353px">Ticking this will allow this record to be viewed on the Public Portal.&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="width:182px">Public Uploads</td>
			<td style="width:353px">Ticking this will allow documents to be displayed on the public portal for viewing.&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>Upon completing the configuration, the user must then select 'Save' to apply the changes to this particular record.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: The online configuration must be saved before you can set up the public visibility of documents.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Dog_FILES/Dogs redaction.PNG"></p>

<p><strong>Public Documents</strong></p>

<p>The same document redaction functionality was previously implemented within the systems licensing module that provided users with the ability to redact/censor documents where appropriate before sharing the document via the public portal.</p>

<p>This will enable users to publish files on the online portal whilst redacting certain sensitive information from public view.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How to redact a document and share it via the Public Portal&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. Upload document via the Uploaded Files left hand menu.&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. Once the document has been uploaded successfully, the file will then be present within the online details area as shown below. The user would then select the 'Redact' button for the relevant file.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Dog_FILES/RedactButton.JPG"></p>

<p>3. The Redaction Tool will be loaded in a new tab within your browser.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Dog_FILES/redactionTool.JPG"></p>

<p>Point and click on the document to start redacting information. Information should be redacted line by line. Clicking once will indicate the start of the redaction line, and clicking again on the horizontal axis will mark the end of the redaction line.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Dog_FILES/redaction1.JPG"></p>

<p>Users will note some additional functionality found within the redaction screen which functions as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Hide/Show Redaction - Click between hiding and showing the information displayed underneath the redaction lines.</li>
	<li>Redact - Click to enable the Redaction tool to begin redacting information.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Redact Slider - Slide to increase/decrease the size of the redaction tool.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Arrows - Click to move the document position within the tab.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Plus/Minus Sign - Click to Zoom in and Out</li>
	<li>Rotate Sign - Click to rotate the document.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Undo - Undo last change</li>
	<li>Redo - Redo last undone change.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Clear - Clears all redaction lines from document.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Save - Saves the document with applied changes.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Layers - Will allow users to remove redaction lines individually.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>4. When the relevant areas of the file have been redacted/censored the user must then select the 'Save' option. A green banner will appear temporarily to confirm the save was successful. Once this is confirmed, the tab can be closed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>5. Reviewing the file within the Online Details configuration&nbsp;area you will now see a small icon of the Redacted document beside the redact button. The icon can be clicked in order to download a copy of the redacted document.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Dog_FILES/redactedDoc1.JPG"></p>

<p>Provided that the Online Details are configured for live, clicking the Public checkbox will ready the redacted document for sharing via the portal.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: All documents saved in the Uploaded Files left hand menu will appear here to share on the public portal. For those that have not previously been redacted the above redaction process would be used.</p>

<p>If a document&nbsp;is acceptable to share on the public portal without redaction, then the Bypass checkbox should be ticked as appropriate.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Dog_FILES/ByPass.JPG"></p>

<p>Upon completing the above steps the end user would then ensure the 'Publish Uploads' checkbox has been selected followed by saving the changes made to the online details configuration for the Dogs record.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Dog_FILES/onlineconfigfin.JPG"></p>

<p><strong>Stray Dogs Register</strong></p>

<p>The Stray Dogs Register will appear on your council/authority's version of Council Direct and will look something like the following:</p>

<p><strong>New Applications</strong></p>

<p>When a licensing application is submitted via the Council Direct portal, it will appear on the public protection system, under Licensing &gt; Online Applications &gt; New Applications.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br>
These applications will appear here in order of most recently received and at initial glance will provide a summary of the information submitted such as the basic licence information and verification on whether the application has been paid for.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/1.JPG"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Any applications which have not automatically matched both the proposed licence holder and the proposed licensable area with existing records on the system, will show as "unmatched" under the licence location column (for more details on matching see below).&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Search Submissions</strong></p>

<p>Online Applications that have been processed will automatically be removed from the New Applications area. The search submissions area can be used to search for such applications.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/2.JPG"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When a result is clicked on, users will be able to review details of the online application as it appeared immediately prior to being processed. If the online application was accepted a visual queue will display at the bottom of the screen as follows:</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/3.JPG"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Online Activity</strong></p>

<p>The online activity area has been designed to keep users abreast of any updates made by council direct users to previously submitted online applications. Please note that online applications can only be updated whilst the online application is pending a decision.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/4.JPG"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to the details of the online application that it relates to, users will note that the activity and content columns provide a summary of the activity that has occurred. Clicking on the entry will navigate the user to the online application record. Clicking the read checkbox will remove the adjacent activity from the list.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Processing Online Applications - Basic Overview</strong></p>

<p>The following section will provide users with a list of considerations, alongside a basic workflow for processing online applications.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. Payments&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prior to processing an online application, users should ensure that they review the payment status of the application, verifying that the amount and payment status is as expected.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/5.JPG"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. Matching Proposed Licence Holder and Proposed Licence Area</p>

<p>The public protection system will automatically attempt to match the proposed licence holder and the proposed licence area (contact/location etc) automatically upon receipt of the online application.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The data provided at submission, will be compared against appropriate records stored in the database, and if an acceptable match is found, this will be populated against the online record in the adjacent matched column.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/6.JPG"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If a match has not been found, or if the match suggested by the system is not suitable, the search button should be used in order to query the appropriate record in the system.<br>
<br>
<em>Please note that the matching logic is not infallible. Users should always take care to verify ALL system matches, to ensure that the correct details are being processed.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. Linking Online Applications to Existing Licences</p>

<p>If the user identifies that an online application relates to an existing licence record it should be linked accordingly.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/7.JPG"></p>

<p><br>
Clicking the search button will direct users to a licence search form, where the appropriate licence can be located and selected.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/8.JPG"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The user will be immediately prompted to save the record in order to pull through the existing licence details.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4. Processing the New Application</p>

<p>With all of the above in hand, we can now start processing the rest of the information in order to process our new application record.</p>

<p>Section 1 - Application Details</p>

<ul>
	<li>Licence Area Discription - Free text field to record the Licence Area Discriptio&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Manual Reference - Free text field to record the Manual Reference (if appropriate)</li>
	<li>Licence Reference - Free text field to record the Licence Reference</li>
	<li>Received By - Drop down to select the officer receiving the application.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Received Date - Date selection field to record the application received date.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Officer - Drop down to select the officer responsible for the application.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Section 2 - Additional Licence Data and Licence Specific Tab</p>

<ul>
	<li>All new online applications will provide a summary of the details submitted by the council direct user as part of their online application. This information will be displayed in read only format and should be reviewed as appropriate to ensure that all necessary detail, attachments etc have been provided.</li>
	<li>If an application has been linked to an existing licence per "Step 3", then users will also be required to review and compare the submitted information against the information on the existing licence record.&nbsp;<br>
	<img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/9.JPG"><br>
	<br>
	Users will see information submitted by the council direct user on the left, and information that exists on the linked record on the right. The radio buttons should be used as appropriate, to select the required information that should appear on the new application.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>5. Saving and Selecting a Status</p>

<p>Once the online application is ready, the user should select a online application status. The status dropdown is populated via Admin &gt; Licensing &gt; Online Submission Status.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>If a status with the "submission accepted" checkbox against it is saved, then a new Application record will be created and the council direct user will be notified accordingly.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>If a status with the "submission declined" checkbox against it is saved, then the Online Application will be rejected, removed from the list and the council direct user will be notified accordingly.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Full Application Records</strong></p>

<p>Link to the Online Application</p>

<p>Any online application that is accepted will generate a brand new "full application" record within the Licensing Module.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/10.JPG"></p>

<p>The online reference will be located at the top of the main licence tab on the new record. Clicking this will navigate the user to the online application as it appeared immediately prior to acceptance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>View Parent Data Left Hand Menu</p>

<p>In such instances where a user has linked an online application to an existing licence record, an additional left hand menu item will be available. This left hand menu, provides (similar to step 4 above) a comparison between details recorded on the application and the parent record.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Here users can review and compare data between the application and the parent licence record. Also if necessary, the user can select conditions from the parent licence, to copy across to the new application.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/11.JPG"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Similar to before, the existing content can be selected and saved so that they can be transferred to the application record.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Customer and Council Comments</strong></p>

<p>One last area which we initially bypassed in the above workflow is the comments section, attached to every new Online Application.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Status History</h1>

<p>The Status History left hand menu against Licence Applications/Records will automatically record changes to the application/licence status throughout its life-cycle.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/status.png"></p>

<table class="table table-bordered" style="height:347px; width:728px">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td style="width:129px"><strong>Field</strong></td>
			<td style="width:578px"><strong>Description</strong></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="width:129px">Start Date</td>
			<td style="width:578px">Automatically populated with the date the status was set.&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="width:129px">End Date</td>
			<td style="width:578px">Empty until such time as that status is changed to another.&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="width:129px">Issue Date</td>
			<td style="width:578px">If present at the time of the status change, taken from the record at the time of the status change.&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>

			<td style="width:129px">Status</td>
			<td style="width:578px">Description of the status being referenced.&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>

			<td style="width:129px">Officer</td>
			<td style="width:578px">Office who made the status change.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="width:129px">Comments</td>
			<td style="width:578px">Comment is automatically taken from the recorded change (if provided).&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>The above fields are all read only UNLESS the user has been granted the "can edit licence status history" privilege in which case these can be edited and/or removed completely as appropriate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Licence Committees</h1>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>We are pleased to confirm the addition of a new Licence Committees area (found within the Licence Module). This new functionality will allow users to mark and prepare Licence Applications for Committee Hearings and document these records along with their associated data as part of a Committee Report.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Initial Setup and User Profiles</strong></p>

<p>In order to access the Licence Committee area within the Licencing Module, users will need to have the necessary permissions applied to their user profile. Simply navigate to the user profile (or user group if applicable) and set the privilege for "Licence Committees". Similar to other privileges, this can be set to Read/Write, Read Only or No Access at all.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/committee perm.PNG"></p>

<p>In addition, a system Admin user should ensure that both Licence Committee Agenda Templates and Licence Committee Outcome Types are defined prior to the use of the Licence Committee area. These can be found in Admin &gt; Licensing and are explained below in this article. Additionally licence statuses will need to be updated and or/created as necessary.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Licence Committee Left Hand Menu</strong></p>

<p>Users with relevant permissions will find a new licence committee left hand menu, with the Licence module area.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/committee lhm.PNG"></p>

<p>Here users can view a list of most recently added committees in addition to performing specific searches for Licence Committees.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/committee search.PNG"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Create a New Licence Committee</strong></p>

<p>To create a new Licence Committee, simply select the Create Committee left hand menu option, which will take you to the create committee form.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/create committee.PNG"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stage Ready Licence Applications</p>

<p>Under this sub menu, users will be able to view a list of applications that are available for selection for the committee hearing/report. .&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Please note, ONLY licence applications which have a licence status that is marked in admin as "Ready for Committee" will appear here. To update those statuses which would be applicable for committee, or, to create new statuses, simply navigate to Admin &gt; Licensing &gt; Licence Statuses. Here the "ready for committee" checkbox should be ticked, as shown in the screenshot below.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/ststus.PNG"></p>

<p>The Show All/Hide All Button can be toggled to display/hide the list of licence applications as appropriate.&nbsp;To select a licence application simply click the select button, which in turn will move it to the select licence applications sub menu. A select all button allows users to move all licence applications if necessary.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/move.PNG"></p>

<p>Selected Licence Applications</p>

<p>Any licence applications which have been moved from the aforementioned sub menu, will then appear in the selected licence applications area. The same Show All/Hide All button is available with a De-Select/De-Select All option to push licence applications back to the stage ready area.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One additional piece of functionality that users will notice here is the ability to record Slot Start/End Times. These are time specific fields, so that licence applications can be defined to appear in the committee report in a specific order.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/times.PNG"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Selected Licences</strong></p>

<p>Now that we have created our Licence Committee, each Licence that we have selected against it, will be updated to mark it as being part of your Licence Committee.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/committee licence record.PNG"></p>

<p>Any user that views the licence, will note that the relevant committee details are displayed, namely the committee hearing date, the actual date and the specific licence committee outcome.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Managing Committees and Preparing for Committee Hearing</strong></p>

<p>Now that we have set up our basic licence committee, its time to start building it up so that we can generate our committee report in preparation for the committee hearing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once created and saved, each licence committee record, will update to display a number of additional tabs as follows:</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/tabs.PNG"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Details</p>

<p>See create licence committees section above. All information originally entered here can be edited and updated as appropriate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Action Applications</p>

<p>Prior to preparing our committee report, users can opt to update some/all selected licences with one or more actions dependent upon user workflow requirements.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/add actions.PNG"></p>

<p>To prepare an action to be added, simply select the Core Function and associated Action Code along with any relevant remarks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each Licence Application will then be listed below, with a check box alongside it. Simply check the relevant licences or use the top most checkbox to select all - when ready, simply hit save and an action will be generated against each application record.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/action licence.PNG"></p>

<p>Once any actions have been added, they will be listed against each relevant application record for ease of reference.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/list action.PNG"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Appendix</p>

<p>The Appendix area allows users to determine what information should appear within the appendices of the committee report. Similar to the tab previous, each selected licence application will be listed here. Within each licence area users will see collapsible lists of all actions, communications and uploaded files associated to that record.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/append.PNG"></p>

<p>Each licence application, in addition to each appendix area can be specified as appropriate using the collapsible menus. Using this functionality, users should be able to specify a combination of licences and associated data specific to their needs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Agenda</p>

<p>The Agenda area is where we generate our committee report. It is comprised of the Agenda and the Final Agenda.</p>

<p>Agenda: This is the customisable part of the overall Committee Report and can be defined in Admin &gt;&nbsp;Licence Committee Agenda Templates. Whatever information is defined here, will be replicated underneath every Licence Application inserted in to the final Committee Report. For example, each Licence Application will appear with the Application Number however, if there is additional information from the records that I wish to include I could insert relevant smarty codes here eg: Applicant Name, Licence Type etc etc.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Final Agenda: The final agenda combines the previous document with the selected appendices to form a final committee report document.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/agenda.PNG"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<table class="table table-bordered" style="height:122px; width:639px">

			<td style="width:90px">Preview Agenda</td>
			<td style="width:331px">Allows a preview of the Agenda to be opened in a new tab.&nbsp;</td>

	</tbody>
</table>

<p>Once the agenda has been generated it will be saved against the record as a pdf and can be clicked on to be viewed if necessary. If an amendment needs to be made, it should be deleted and added again.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/agenda generated.PNG"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once happy with the agenda, clicking Generate Final Document will create our final Committee Report. Similar to the previous step,&nbsp;it will be saved against the record as a pdf and can be clicked on to be viewed if necessary. If an amendment needs to be made, it should be deleted and generated again.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Please Note - Any changes made to the Licence Committee&nbsp;Record across any of the tabs, should be saved prior to running the Agenda documents.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Once the Final Agenda Document is generated and is acceptable, the user should SAVE the record. An example first page from a dummy report is shown below.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/example report.PNG"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Outcomes</p>

<p>The final tab on the Licence Committee record allows users to record the Outcomes of any selected Licence Applications following Committee Hearing along with any associated notes.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/outcome tab.PNG"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please note that these outcomes must be defined in Admin &gt; Licensing &gt; Licence Committee Outcome Types.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As you can can see in the above screenshot, an Outcome Type is relatively simple to define. It is however worth noting that as user can determine whether an Action is generated against the Licence Application record when that Outcome Type is selected. If so, then the core function and action code should be defined as appropriate.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/ad action.PNG"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once a Licence Application has had an Outcome Type defined, and the record is saved, these changes (along with the addition of an action if specified) will be reflected on the Licence Application.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Licence Renewal Automation</h1>

<p>The licensing module now allows for automatic generation of renewal invitations; licencees can be notified of their impending renewal via email or council/direct as appropriate.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Please note that this functionality is Tascomi controlled; if you wish it to be enabled please do not hesitate contact us.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Initial Admin Configuration</strong></p>

<p>Before enabling this functionality users should review their Admin setup to ensure that it is configured correctly. Auto renewal applications are generated based on the Admin configuration per Licence Type. With the recent introduction of configurable licence types per authority (shared systems) then this effectively will need to be configured per licence type per authority.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Admin &gt; Licence Type Admin</strong></p>

<p>First of all navigate to the licence type you wish to configure. Once here, be sure to select the tab for your council (if required) and you will notice the first four settings relate to renewals.</p>

</table>

<p><strong><em>&nbsp;*Please note that whilst "Create Renewal Application or Renewal" is planned future functionality, it will need to be checked for "Include Auto Renewal" to work.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Include Auto Renewal</strong></p>

<p>The first part of this functionality will review any licences due within the specified reminder period and do the following:</p>

<p>i) Online Council Direct Issued Licence? If Yes then issue Council Direct generated reminder email.&nbsp; If no, then move to step ii.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ii) Licensee Email Exists? If Yes then issue PP generated reminder email. If no, then move to step iii.</p>

<p>iii) If neither of the above mark licence as due for renewal. User can then use batch print facility to issue reminders on these records.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Public Documents</strong></p>

<p>Document Redaction and Sharing documents on the public portal. We have added new functionality which will not only allow users to share certain documents via the public portal but allow these documents to be redacted/censored in part where appropriate. This will enable users to publish files on the online portal whilst redacting certain sensitive information from public view.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>NB - Please note that documents should be saved in pdf format in order to work with the redaction tool.&nbsp;</em></p>

	<li>Save - Saves the document with applied changes.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Layers - Will allow users to remove redaction lines individually.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>4. Once happy with the document click save. A green banner will appear temporarily to confirm the save was successful. Once this is confirmed, the tab can be closed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>5. Review the Uploaded Files left hand menu. A small icon of the Redacted document will now appear along side our original file upload. The icon can be clicked in order to download a copy of the redacted document.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/redacted pdf.jpg" style="height:123px; width:707px"></p>

<p>6. Review the Online Details left hand menu. Here we fill find the online configuration (see ticket PP-1538 above) for this licence application/record. Users will now notice that the previously redacted document appears here ready to be pushed to the public portal.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Online Portal User FAQ's</h1>

<p><strong>Ques:</strong>&nbsp; User is doing an online application for a scaffolding licence and cannot get past the step of uploading&nbsp; a plans file.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> This is because the system has been configured in the Admin section to expect 2 files to be uploaded for this licence type ie: the plans and the public liability insurance documents.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>The Licensing module allows the user to record and manage all different types of Licence, enabling them to also be monitored and renewed accordingly. The Licensing module has a generic front end used for all types of Licence applications where common information is recorded for all licence applications. In addition to this specific information is recorded on different tabs which appear automatically depending on the type of Licence application being created.</p>

<h1>Licencing Home Page</h1>

<p>Please note it is recommended that users of licensing change the homepage view to show more details about their workload.</p>

<p>To change the homepage view click on the username in the top right of the screen beside 'logged in as'. This opens the ‘User Details’ screen.&nbsp; Click on the homepage drop down and change this to the Officers Overview homepage.</p>

<p>Once a user has clicked save the officers homepage will change and the below homepage which is split into 3 sections will be displayed:</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/Licensing HomePage.png" style="height:549px; width:694px"></p>

<ol>

</ol>

<ul>
	<li>Licence applications that haven’t been issued or closed.</li>
	<li>Licence application actions that haven’t a completed date</li>
	<li>Service requests that don’t have a completed date</li>
	<li>Service requests actions that haven’t a completed date&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Licences Expired or due to expire without an application</strong>. This shows all licences that have an expiry date from the last 2 months and due to expire in the next month that don’t have an active licence application pending.</li>
</ol>

<p>Clicking on any record shown will bring you directly to that record.&nbsp; If you click on any record and want to return to your home page please click on the Home icon located at the top left hand corner.<strong>&nbsp; </strong></p>

<p><strong>Licence Module</strong></p>

<p>The Licence module can be accessed from the icon at the top of the screen. When selecting the ‘Licensing’ icon the user will be taken to the view application page.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are 3 sections:</p>

<p>Also the online application has the following fields that are not mandatory and can be updated prior to the application being accepted</p>

<ul>
	<li>Licence Area Description This free text field allows the user to enter details of the specific area that is being licensed. For example, if the license is for a specific part of the premise i.e. Ground Floor Function Room’ then this can be specified in this text field</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/search-sub.png" style="height:292px; width:568px"></p>

<h1>View Applications</h1>

<p>The ‘View Application’ option is the default option and is therefore the same view that is displayed when selecting the Licence module from the icon list. This option displays a list of all existing Licencing applications allowing the user to view/update records as required. After viewing an application the user can return to the list either by clicking on ‘Close’ or choosing the ‘View Application’ from the upper top left hand menu option.</p>

After viewing a record the user can return to the list either by clicking on ‘Close’ or choosing the ‘View Licence’ from the upper top left hand menu option.</p>

<p>Once a licence is selected, if the user wants to add or renew that licence the system will allocate a new application number and the licence number from that original licence record will automatically appear on the new or renewal application. &nbsp;When a licence record is viewed subject to the configuration by the system administrator a user will be able to</p>

<table class="table table-bordered">
	<tbody>
		<tr>

			<td>
			<p><strong>Renew the licence. </strong></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>This ‘Renew‘icon will allow the user to renew the application and link it to that licence.&nbsp; Once the user selects ‘renewal’ icon, the licence application screen appears with licence fields automatically updated with data from the licence record. The system will also generate a unique application number which will displayed in the application field.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>Once an application record is added to the licence, all linked applications can be viewed from the licence record using the licence history option in the left hand menu. &nbsp;</p>

<h1>Search Licences</h1>

<p>The ‘Search Licences’ option allows the user to find licences by filling in the required search criteria.&nbsp; Selecting this option presents the user with the following screen:</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/Licensing search licence.png" style="height:725px; width:1415px"></p>

<p>Users can enter as little or as much information on the License Record Search screen followed by clicking the ‘Search’ button to return matching results. To start a new search, clicking ‘Clear’ removes previously entered search criteria.</p>

<p>The results of the search can be printed via the browser shortcut of &lt;Control&gt; and &lt;P&gt; keys. Users can click on items returned by the search to view/update the corresponding record.</p>

<h1>Batch Print</h1>

<p>The ‘Batch Print’ of licences allows the user to find licences by filling in the required search criteria and then selecting the ones required before printing them.&nbsp; Selecting this option presents the user with the following screen:</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/Licencing batch print.png"></p>

<p>Users can enter as little or as much information on the Batch Print Search screen followed by clicking the ‘Search’ button to return matching results. To start a new search, clicking ‘Clear’ removes previously entered search criteria.</p>

<p>The results of the search can then be selected and the licences printed.&nbsp; The checkbox on the far right of the matching results list on each line allows the user to indicate the licences that they want to be printed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject to configuration, the ‘print’ icon will allow the user to print the licences required.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Renewals</h1>

<p>The Licence Renewal option allows users to create Licence Renewal records based on specified criteria. This allows users to renew individual Licences, those of a specific type or those that are due to expire within a certain date range.</p>

<p>Prior to processing Licence Renewals, it is important that the renewal template has been configured in the System Administration area as well as the Renewal Application Type which is automatically used when processing Licences in a renewal (not New) capacity.</p>

<p>When selecting this option the user is presented with the following screen:</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/146.png"></p>

<p>This screen allows the user to enter as little or as much selection criteria as required. Once the desired criteria are entered, clicking on the ‘Search’ button at the bottom of the screen will display a list of matching Licence records with these attributes. <strong>Please note that only Licence records that have an Expiry date and are not Closed will be returned when searching for candidate Renewals.</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the selection criteria returns more information than required, further criteria can be added to refine the search or alternatively, pressing ‘clear’ removes the criteria allowing a new search to be carried out. In the following example, the user has searched for a specific Licence number:</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/147.png"></p>

<p>In order to create both the renewal letters and the new licensing transaction (application effectively), the user must click the ‘Print’ button. On clicking this option the user will be prompted if they wish to continue the transaction (which can be cancelled at this stage if started in error) and progress as required.</p>

<p>If the user continues with the renewal process a popup window appears containing all of the renewal letters. These can be subsequently printed using the standard browser print shortcut of &lt;Control&gt; and &lt;P&gt;.</p>

<p>Once the renewal communication has been issued the appropriate letter is attached to the relevant record(s) and the user can create the renewal record once the renewal information is received.</p>

<p>When viewing the License record (pending renewal), an additional button appears at the top right hand side of the interface which allows the user to access the renewal record in the form of chevrons |&gt;&gt;|.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/148.png"></p>

<p>Clicking on the chevron 'Renewal button' displays the renewal record which is essentially a copy of the previous Licence but will require the user to process Fees, complete relevant Pre-requisites and contact the relevant Consultees accordingly before issuing/completing this instance of the Licence record.</p>

<p>In the following example, the renewal record has been accessed and the user will need to choose the fee information for the renewal record. Once the fees have been paid together with pre-requisites and consultees the Licence can be issued. The licence number remains the same, but the user can use the 'reverse chevron' button |&lt;&lt;| at the top right hand side to access the previous (pre-renewal) Licence instance details.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/149.png"></p>

<h1>Create Licence Application</h1>

<p>The ‘Create Application’ option allows the user to create new Licence application records. Before a new licence is created we would recommend using the search option initially to ensure that the record is not already on the system&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Choosing the create option presents the user with the following screen:</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/Licensing Create application.png"></p>

<p>When creating a new Licence record, the user is prompted to enter the following fields:</p>

<table class="table table-bordered" style="height:451px; width:560px">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><strong>Licence Area </strong></p>

			<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>The drop down allows the user to choose the area used for the search. The options in the list are for Premise, Location and Contact. By clicking the corresponding search button, the user is able to search/create (subject to security permissions) the appropriate set of data to locate the property, location or contact.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>The licence area is a required field and you have choose <strong>one</strong> of the following search options&nbsp;</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Location – is used for the recording of the location of the premises to be licenced. Searching for the location uses your councils gazetteer, which is stored and maintained&nbsp; in the system</li>
				<li>Contact – is used where an application is for a Person rather than a location. Searching the contact database allows the applicant to be linked to an existing or new contact</li>
			</ol>

			<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Premises is used if the licence application is for a premises monitored by other business areas in the council for instance managing food premises or health and safety etc. If this is required you will have to create and search for the premise before a licence application is created.</p>

<h1>Application to Licence</h1>

<p>The ‘View Application’ option allows the user to amend Licence application records. Before an application is becomes a licence we would recommend using the search option initially to ensure that the record is not already on the system record.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please note the start, expiry, issue and closed dates will only appear on the licence tab when the status field is changed e.g. granted.&nbsp; Also the start, expiry, issue and closed date fields will only be displayed if licensing status has been configured by the system administrator.</p>

<p><img src="https://servicedesk.idoxgroup.com/images/cloud/PPR/Licensing_FILES/Licencing Applications  to licence.png"></p>

<p><br>
If an application is ready to become a licence, the status field on the licencing screen will need to be updated before the start, expiry and issue dates on a licence can be entered.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But before this status field is changed on the application the following fields must be completed:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Pre-requisites - All mandatory prerequisites on an application on the Pre-Requisites screen must have a completed date against them</li>
	<li>Fees - All Application fees must be paid and the display only field called outstanding balance should on the licencing screen must display £0:00</li>
</ul>

<p>When an application becomes a licence, the user must be on the licence tab of the record and then enter the following information:</p>

<table class="table table-bordered">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><strong>Status</strong></p>

			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>

By closing a Licence record it will no longer appear on renewals, it will not appear under ‘View Licenses’ and will only return in search results where users request ‘Closed’ records. This can be entered manually, chosen from the calendar control or by entering 't' for a shortcut to the current date.</p>

<p>When attaching files, it is essential that the format used is one that can be accessed by other users i.e. it is best to use a common document/image file format such as PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT or JPG for example. This will make retrieval and sharing of information much more efficient without the need for any additional proprietary software. In addition, the size of the file that is attached needs to be a consideration as there is a maximum size limit in place for&nbsp;files uploaded. &nbsp;Please note uploading large files can affect local performance particularly if the solution is being used on a mobile.</p>

<p>At the top of the uploaded file&nbsp;screen the following fields from the licence application screen are displayed - application number, licence number, licence area, licence type, application type, licensee, agent and officer.</p>

		<tr>
			<td>Field Name</td>
			<td>Comments</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Communication To</td>
			<td>This drop down will display a list of the types of contacts that can be selected to send the letter to. The list that displays will depend on the record that the action is linked to; so for example, a licence record&nbsp;will allow the user to send to the applicant, whereas an accident record will allow the user to send to the injured person. If the record is linked to a premise the user will also be able to send correspondence to the premise contacts.</td>
		</tr>

<p>This is a facility to allow users save specific searches within a module if they wish to take advantage of these searches on a regular basis. This allows users to save the search parameters they enter, so that they can rebuild the search quickly the next time it is required.&nbsp;The searches that are saved are user specific.</p>

<p>See Screenshots below for an explanation of how to use the feature on the system.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Step 1: &nbsp;Carry out a search by inputting search criteria and click on 'Save Search' button at the bottom of the screen. &nbsp;This example is in the Premises module.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Step 2: &nbsp;Input a name and description for the saved search in the pop up box.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Step 3: Message is displayed saying that the named search has been saved successfully.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Step 4: &nbsp;If user clicks on the new 'Saved Searches' button in the left hand menu, a list of the saved searches are displayed. Users can also search for the saved search by name given to a specific search.</p>
