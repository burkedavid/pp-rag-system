# Accidents Guide

## Overview

The Accidents module allows the user to view and record reportable accidents at places of work for Health and Safety purposes. By selecting this option the user is presented with a list of existing accident records which can be viewed or updated as required. Clicking a record entry allows the user to view/update the details.

## RIDDOR

Users can record the RIDDOR report and associated scoring against Accident Records. This can be controlled via the RIDDOR left hand menu option found against all Accident records. Clicking on the RIDDOR left hand menu will take users to a form as shown in the screenshot below.

### Scoring

Users should complete the scores for each area using the dropdown boxes provided. As scores are recorded the will display along the right hand side, whilst a total score is calculated automatically at the bottom.

### Remarks

Users can record any relevant information using the remarks text box.

### Reason For Deviation

Users will note guidelines for follow up action required based on score. If deviation away from the recommended action is necessary, the Reason for Deviation text box should be used to detail the reason why.

### Agreed Line Manager

User should enter name of the line manager who has agreed the appropriate course of action. This must be completed in order to save the form.

### Date

Enter the date the above form was completed. This must be completed in order to save the form.

Once the form has been completed, the user should click SAVE. (If the form is saved without all the fields being completed, they will be returned to the form to complete the missing information.) Users will be informed that the form will be locked for editing before saving.

## View Accidents

The 'View Accidents' option is the default option that is displayed when selecting the Accidents module. This displays a list of all existing accident records allowing the user to view/update them as required. After viewing a record the user can return to this complete list either by clicking on 'Close' or choosing the 'View Accidents' menu option.

## Search Accidents

The 'Search Accidents' option on the left hand menu allows the user to find accident records based on desired search criteria. The search functionality is consistent with that in all other module areas.

Users can enter as little or as much information in the accident search screen followed by clicking the 'Search' button in order to return matching results. To start a new search, clicking 'Clear all data' removes the previously entered search criteria.

The results of the search can be printed via the browser using <Control> and <P> keys or, alternatively, exported to MS Excel or MS Word using the corresponding buttons.

## Create Accidents

The Create Accident option allows the user to add new accident records to the system. When selecting this option, the user is presented with the following screen:

When creating accident records, the user is prompted to enter the following fields:

| Field Name | Comments |
|------------|----------|
| Premise Name | This search option allows the user to search the premise database for the premise where the accident occurred. After carrying out the search, the selected premise record is displayed. If a premise record has been chosen in error the process can be repeated in order to reselect. |
| Officer | The officer drop down allows the user to choose who is responsible for managing this accident record. |
| Accident Date | This date field allows the user to choose who is responsible for managing this accident record. |
| Accident Time | This field allows the user to record the time of the accident. Please note that this requires the HH (24 Hour) and MM (Minute) elements of the time to be entered in the two fields. |
| Date Reported | This date field allows the user to record the date that the accident was reported to the Local Authority. Dates can be entered manually, chosen from the calendar or entering 't' and tab as a shortcut to the current date. |
| Reporting Method | This drop down allows the user to specify how the accident was reported i.e. telephone and email |
| Employee/Public | These radio buttons allow the user to identify if the accident involved an employee of the premise or a member of the public. |
| Injury Category | The drop down allows the user to choose the category of the injury. |
| Reportable | This checkbox allows the user to specify if the accident is reportable. For accidents that are not reportable, the checkbox should be left blank. |
| Accident Type | This drop down allows the user to choose the type of accident that occurred. |
| Response Method | This drop down allows the user to choose the method that was used for the first response in relation to the accident. |
| Response Date | This date field allows the user to specify the date that the accident was responded to. Dates can be entered manually, chosen from the calendar control or entering 't' and tab as a shortcut to the current date. |
| Remarks | This free text field allows the user to enter any additional information related to the accident being entered. |
| Name of Injured | This search button searches the contact database allowing the accident to be linked to an existing contact. If required, a new contact record for the injured person can be created following this (which is subject to suitable admin permissions) as the 'Create' option only appears after carrying out a search. Once a contact record has been chosen, the user can repeat the process to replace the selected contact record (if incorrect) or also click on the contact record to view and edit existing details. |
| Manual Reference | When the accident record is saved, a unique reference number is generated. This field allows the user to enter a manual reference number if required. |
| Injury Description | This free text field allows the user to describe the injury relating to the accident record. |
| Corporate | This checkbox allows the user to indicate if the accident took place at a corporate organisation. |
| Completed Date | Entering a completed date indicates that no further action is required on this accident record. Dates can be entered manually, chosen from the calendar control or entering the letter 't' and tab as a shortcut to the current date. Any accident that does not have a completed date remains on the associated officers Homepage awaiting completion/resolution. |

Once the information has been completed, pressing the 'Save' button creates the accident record and allocates the unique reference number. Please note that left hand menu options available allow the user to attach a copy of the accident form/RIDDOR Report if required (can be done using RIDDOR Reports or Uploaded Files).

## Batch Update

The 'Batch Update' option is used when updating a batch of accidents and provides a simple mechanism of finding accident records which the user can then open in sequence and update the details. This batch update is designed for users who have a number of accident records to find and update.

After entering the required criteria, clicking on 'Search' executes the search and displays matching results.

The user can click on the required accident record to update. Once done, clicking the 'close' button returns them to the search for further updates to the results shown as necessary.

## Notices

The Notices left hand menu option displays a list of existing Notice records in relation to the current accident record, with the facility to add new Notices as required.

Clicking the 'Add' button allows a new Notice to be created on the selected Accident record. When adding notices directly from an accident record the premise details linked to the accident will automatically be populated.
