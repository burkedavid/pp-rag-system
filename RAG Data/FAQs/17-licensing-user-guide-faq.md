## User Access and Permissions

## Tips for Effective Use

### What should I know about "open" records?

Open records are those without a completed or actual date. For the Licence module specifically, these include applications that haven't been turned into licences yet. Once you record a completed date for a case, it will no longer appear in the "My Overview" list.

### How do I handle expired licences?

The system can list licences that are expired or due to expire without an active application pending. This helps you identify licences that may need renewal attention, typically showing licences with expiry dates up to one or two months in the past.

### What information is available in the Officers Overview?

The Officers Overview includes:
- **Online Submission section**: Lists licensing applications submitted online and received by the system
- **Officers section**: Shows each officer with summaries of records assigned to them
- **Expired licences**: Lists licences needing attention due to expiry dates
