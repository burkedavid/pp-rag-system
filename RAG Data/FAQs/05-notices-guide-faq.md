# Notices Guide

## Introduction to Notices

Traditionally Notices existed as a left hand menu option against various record types including Premises, Service Requests, Inspections etc. As the functionality behind Notices has grown, it was determined that a Module dedicated to Notices was necessary. Each Notice created within the system can now be found within the Notices Module negated the previous requirement to search for them via the Actions Module.

Please note that access to this module is controlled via the Notices permission in Admin: Admin > Users > List Users > Select Users.

## View Notices

The View Notices left hand menu, will display all Notices available in the system. These are ordered automatically by Notice ID, with the most recently added Notice appearing at the top.

The list of Notices can be re-ordered by any of the display column headings simply by click on the column heading.

## Search Notices including Saved Searches

The Search Notices left hand menu allows users to search for Notice records throughout the system. Any of the provided fields can be used to filter results as appropriate.

The Save Search button can also be used to save a particular set of search criteria for future use. Simply click on the Save Search button and insert a name and description for the search. This search will be saved to the Saved Searches left hand menu for future use.

## Create Notice - Including Edit Notice and Left Hand Menu Options

### Create / Edit Notice

The Create Notice left hand menu option will let users create a new notice. Please note, that when adding a notice it must be tied to a parent record such as a contact, premise etc.

When a user clicks on the Create Notice option, they will be presented with the following screen:
