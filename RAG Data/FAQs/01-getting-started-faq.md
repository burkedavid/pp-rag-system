# Getting Started with Public Protection

## Home Page - Team Lead Overview

We have created a new home page specifically designed with Team Leads in mind. In order to view this home page, users will need to configure it against their user profile.

Users wishing to use the Team Lead Overview should note that additional configuration is required against their user settings in Admin. Users will be required to select which officers and which modules they want to appear in the Team Lead Overview.

Once the Team Lead Overview option has been selected and the admin configured, the Team Lead Overview should be ready for use.

Along the left hand side users will be presented with an overview for those modules in the system that were selected. To the right users will then see a specific breakdown on this information for each selected user.

For the user specific details, clicking into each module (Inspections, Service Requests etc) will give a breakdown specific to that user. Furthermore, clicking on the number here will present a list of the specific records which in turn can be used to link direct into the record itself.

## Introduction

The Tascomi Public Protection solution is a web-based product which has been developed in conjunction with Tascomi users through continual development and improvement, in order to meet the demanding needs of Local Authority Public Protection staff.

The purpose of this document is to explain each of the functional areas of the solution for use by end users. The manual is designed to explain how to operate the software but has not been designed to describe the associated processes and workflows which will may used with the software as these can be often updated and changed in line with the customer's requirements.

For system administration and maintenance, please see the Tascomi Public Protection System Administration Manual.

Being browser based users are therefore able to access the solution using any compatible web browser. Please note however, that it is essential to use an up to date web browser with the software; this should be the latest or previous browser release unless agreed otherwise with Tascomi. Supported web browsers include the latest versions of Internet Explorer, Firefox, Google Chrome and Apple Safari.

Access to options within the solution will be subject to suitable security permissions within each of the module areas. This can be set using the 'Admin' module by users with appropriate permissions - refer to the System Administration Manual as noted above for guidance on this.

The solution is designed to be very intuitive and Tascomi recommend that users read the following section of this document as a minimum which explains the standard conventions used throughout the solution.

## Password Recovery and Maintenance

### Password Recovery

If the user enters an invalid username and password combination, they will be presented with a password recovery screen. A user will have three incorrect login attempts before their individual account is 'Locked' and must be re-enabled by the Organisation's local System Administrator. The password recovery screen however will allow the user to enter their valid username a new password will be generated and sent to the email address registered against their individual user record.

If an invalid username is entered, the user will be informed. Upon entering a valid username and clicking 'Submit' the solution will prompt the user to check their email.

### Password Maintenance

All users should ensure that they change the default password issues to them for initial login. In addition, passwords should be changed as required by an Organisation's ICT security protocol. To change the password click on the username in the top right of the screen beside 'logged in as'. This opens the 'User Details' screen.

To change a password:

- Delete the contents of both Password fields in the User Details screen
- Enter a new password in the first Password field
- Confirm this password by re-typing it into the second Password field
- Click 'Save' to update the changes or click 'Home' to go to the home page without saving the changes

**Note: the password fields display a 'mask' which obscures both the characters used and the length of the password recorded. Always erase such an entry before inputting a new password. Also, Tascomi advise that any 'Remember Passwords' functionality available within the web browser in use is disabled for both security and practical reasons when updating/resetting passwords.**

## How to Edit User Details

It is very important that Tascomi Public Protection Users keep their details up to date within the system for both account validity and password recovery as well as system-generated communication purposes. To check user details at any time click on the username in the top right of the screen beside 'logged in as'. This opens the 'User Details' screen, allowing the following details to be amended:

### User Detail Fields

**Username**: Displays the users username. Not editable.

**First Name**: Enter the users first name.

**Surname**: Enter the users surname.
