## Online Food Business Registration

**NB - Please be aware that this article has been reproduced from a similar guide found on our NI Enviro help centre. Please pardon any discrepancies found in the included screenshots whilst we update and finalise this article. Users should still find this guide useful however in understanding the basic functionality offered by Online Food Business Registrations.**

### Introduction

Together with Idox's Public Protection product, the Food Standards Agency website allows food business owners to register their food business online. Any registration submitted via the FSA website will now appear within the Public Protection product ready to be processed.

### Additional Admin Privilege

Within the user admin area (Admin > General > Select User) an additional permission has been added 'Online Food Business Registrations' as indicated in the screenshot below:

**Note:** The introduction of Online Food Premise Registrations has prompted additional fields within the Premise Food tab - this is to cater for the information captured within the online food registration form. As requested, we have recently applied a change whereby users will not require the Online Food Business Registration permission in order to view the additional fields within the Premises Food Tab.

### Online Food Business Registrations

Upon applying the aforementioned user permission this will then display an additional left hand menu area for Online Food Business Registrations which can be accessed by navigating to the Premises Module.

There is also a numeric value displayed which indicates how many online registrations have been received and are awaiting processing.

### Processing An Online Food Registration

In order to process the online food registration record the first step of the user is to review the information that has been provided in relation to the premise to ensure the information is accurate. Much like other types of online submission, they should be reviewed top to bottom then left to right.

The user will need to review any read/write fields and update/populate these as appropriate: for example, Food Main Usage Code, Responsible Officer and Responsible Team.

The next stage of processing is matching both the Premises Details and the Operator Details with premise and contact records already on the system. Please note that the system will automatically attempt to match, both the premise and operator, and these details will populate the matched column should an appropriate match be found. If this information is not correct the following steps should be followed accordingly.

Within the premises details section select the 'search' button located to the right hand side of the record.

Upon selecting the 'search' button the user will be displayed with the Premises Search screen.

It is recommended that users carry out the search first as this is used to identify if the premise already exists on the system to avoid duplication of premises. Upon selecting search if result(s) are returned the user will then need to select the appropriate premise record that relates to the online record. If the system returns no results this would indicate that the premise has not been recorded on the system previously and will need to be created.

In order to create the premise the user will need to select the 'Create Premises From Online Details' checkbox which will display an additional 'Premise Location Details' section.

The user will then need to follow the search process and search for the location of the premise, if result(s) are returned they will then select the appropriate location.

This will then match the location and completes the matching step for the 'Premise Details' section of the record.

If no results are returned from the search the user will then need to select the 'Create Location From Online Details' checkbox which will create the location upon acceptance of the record.

The same process from above will need to be completed within the Operator Details section beginning with the matching of the operator. The user will need to first search using the 'Search' button to check if the operator already exists within the system.

If no results are found via the search or from by the suggested contacts functionality the user will then need to create the contact based on the information provided in the record. This can be done by selecting the 'Create Contact From Online Details' checkbox.

**Note:** The 'Suggested Contacts' button is available to provide the user with a list of additional potential matches found by the system based on the operator details submitted.

Upon matching all of the information on the right hand side of the record and ensuring all of the information has been populated on the left hand side the user can then proceed with the Acceptance of the online food registration record.

An additional checkbox has been added to the online food registration area which allows users to determine if the record upon acceptance should create an initial inspection entry. In the scenario whereby the Premise does not require a initial inspection record to be automatically generated this checkbox should remain blank.

This particular checkbox will be useful when matching an online food registration record with an existing food premise within the system where a current FHPI inspection may already be scheduled or perhaps if a new premise requires further review before an initial inspection should be scheduled.

If the food premise record requires an initial inspection, the user would ensure the 'Create Initial Inspection' checkbox is selected before accepting. This will then create/match the record within the Premises Module with the relevant information as well as generating the food inspection.

**Note:** We have implemented additional emailing functionality, similar to the rejection emails process whereby the applicant will receive an email to notify them when their online food registration has been accepted.

### Rejecting Applications

When rejecting an online food premise registration the user has the ability to send out further information to the applicant in relation to why the application has been rejected. The user would enter this information within the 'Rejection Reason' text-box followed by selecting the 'Send Rejection Email' checkbox and finalising this by selecting the 'Reject' button. The applicant will then receive an email notifying them of the rejected application including any reasoning information added by the processing user.

### Tracking Food Premises without Initial Inspection

We have added an additional checkbox within the Premises Search screen 'Online Registrations Without Inspection' which will allow users to report on premises that have been created without an initial inspection and the returned results can be exported to Microsoft Word/Excel if required.
