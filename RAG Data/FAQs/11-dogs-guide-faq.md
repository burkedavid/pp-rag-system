# Dogs Guide

## Overview

The Dogs section allows the user to create records relating to lost/found dogs incidents reported. Initially the record raised may relate to a lost dog which can later be progressed as an enquiry, with added information recorded relating to the owner when found/applicable.

Selecting this menu option presents the user with a list of existing Dog records. Users can choose to sort the columns as required and clicking on a record allows them to view the dog record together with related information.

## My Dogs

We have added a new left hand menu to the Dogs Module called My Dogs.

Dog records that display here will be those records where the signed in user is marked as the Dog Warden/Officer responsible.

## View Dogs

Selecting the 'View Dogs' option presents the user with a list of all dog records, which is the same viewing option that is presented when first choosing the Dogs menu option from the top interface bar.

## Search Dogs

The 'Search Dogs' option allows the user to find dog records by filling in the required search criteria. After entering search criteria, clicking 'search' displays the matching results. Search functionality in Dogs is consistent will all other record processing areas of the system.

## Create Dogs

The 'Create Dogs' option allows the user to create new Dog case records. Tascomi would recommend using the search option initially to ensure that the record has not already been created prior to adding a new record.

When creating a new dog record, the user is prompted to enter the following fields:
