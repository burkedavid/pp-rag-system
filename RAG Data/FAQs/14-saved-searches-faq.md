## How to use 'Saved Searches'

This is a facility to allow users save specific searches within a module if they wish to take advantage of these searches on a regular basis. This allows users to save the search parameters they enter, so that they can rebuild the search quickly the next time it is required. The searches that are saved are user specific.

See Screenshots below for an explanation of how to use the feature on the system.

### Step 1: Carry out a search

Carry out a search by inputting search criteria and click on 'Save Search' button at the bottom of the screen. This example is in the Premises module.

### Step 2: Input search details

Input a name and description for the saved search in the pop up box.

### Step 3: Confirmation message

Message is displayed saying that the named search has been saved successfully.

### Step 4: Access saved searches

If user clicks on the new 'Saved Searches' button in the left hand menu, a list of the saved searches are displayed. Users can also search for the saved search by name given to a specific search.
