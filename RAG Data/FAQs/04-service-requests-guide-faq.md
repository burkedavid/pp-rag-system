# Service Requests Guide

## Overview

The Service Request module allows the user to record request for service & complaints calls in relation to premises, addresses and contact records. All types of service requests can be recorded and the type of request is controlled via a coded list separated by departmental functional areas.

Selecting this option presents the user with a list of all existing service request records.

## View Requests & Left Hand Menu Options

### View Requests

Selecting the 'View Request' option presents the user with a list of all current Requests held within the system, regardless of their status. Each can be accessed individually by clicking the desired record. This view is the same view shown to the user when first clicking the Requests module icon from the icon list.

### Left Hand Menu Options

Following selection of a module area the user is provided with a list of the available options on the left hand side of the screen. This will be split into additional options for the module selected together with access to additional related information. For the links to additional information, 'tick' icons alongside the headings (Inspections, File Attachments, Actions etc.) indicate the information is recorded and available to view.

The left hand menu (LHM) options available for selection differ dependent on the module area selected, although there are a high proportion of common options, which are available across all module areas.

When selecting a left hand menu option the user is presented with a list of existing records where applicable which can be viewed or edited dependent on user security privileges. Choosing the option to 'add/create' will create a new record in the selected area.

The common options on the left hand menu (LHM) available across the module areas are as follows:

- **View** - Will return the user to the main record, i.e. the premise, complaint, sample, the user opened
- **Inspections** - Allows the user to add an inspection record to the record. In some module areas users may be able to create inspections in bulk against related records
- **Actions** - This left hand menu allows the user to record an action record in relation to the master record. An action can be used to record any activity in relation with the master record as well as entering actions that need to take place in the future
- **Notices** - This left hand menu allows the user to record an enforcement record in relation to the master record. These records allow information to record legal action that has taken place
- **Correspondence** - The correspondence left hand menu option allows the user to create standard documentation/letters in relation to the master record using pre-defined templates. Templates are configured to include 'merge' information from data that has been recorded such as address detail
- **File Uploads** - This option allows the user to attach certain types of file to the master record. It is important to note that only users that have suitable software can view associated files which are subsequently attached. Tascomi recommended therefore that standard or generic formats such as PDF, GIF and JPG are used to ensure that users can view the attached information. In addition, users need to be aware of the size of images such as photographs that are being attached. Many modern cameras/phones take very high resolution photographs which will result in a large file size which has both storage and retrieval consequences, particularly when operating on a mobile device
- **Emails** - This option allows the user to attach emails to the master record
- **Additional contacts** - This option allows the user to record additional contacts on a record, such as solicitors or head office information

## Seized Goods

The Seized Goods left hand menu will allow officers to record details of seized goods relating to a service request record that do not necessarily require creation of a Notice.

### Field Descriptions

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Seized From | Text field to confirm who the goods were seized from |
| Seized At | Text field to confirm where the goods were seized at |
| Date Received | Date field to confirm the date on which the goods were seized |
| Type of Good | Text field to record the type of good seized |
| Brand | Text field to record the brand of the goods seized |
| Seal Number | Text field to record the seal number of the goods seized |
| Quantity | Numeric field to record the quantity of goods seized |
| Value | Numeric field to record the value of goods seized |
| Officer | Drop down list to populate the officer responsible for seizing the goods |
| Disposal Date | Date field to confirm the date on which the seized goods were disposed of |
| Disposal Details | Text field to record further details concerning the disposal of the goods |

Users can record multiple rows via the "Add Seized Goods" button, and can remove row using the remove button adjacent to the row that isn't needed.

## Editing a Service Request

Users can manage and/or edit a service request simply by clicking on the appropriate service request. Doing so will load the Service Request overview screen and the associated Left Hand Menu options.

From here users can update the appropriate fields and/or add manage the Service Request using the various Left Hand Menu options (communication, inspection etc).

Users should note that immediately after a Service Request is created the Core Function, Request Code and Request Category can be edited. However, as soon as an associated action is carried out against the Service Request which adds an entry against the left hand menu (communication, inspection etc), then these two fields will become locked and users will be prevented from editing them. The ability to edit this information after this point can be controlled in the users setup. Further information concerning this can be found in our Creating and Managing Users section.

## How to Use your Homepage

After logging in, the user will be presented with their Homepage/Home screen.

In some situations, users may be offered an alternative list of programs. This will typically depend on the organisation and user role as to any variation(s) on offer.

By default, this presents a list of all modules that the user has access to.

Each module area displays as a section with a total number of records for each section. There is a limit of 100 records per area per user on the homepage. Clicking on a section's '+' symbol displays a list of the outstanding work for that module area.

Once an item of work has been completed by entering the completed date for the task/item, the record will no longer appear in the Homepage for the user.

Clicking on the 'Home' icon button at any time returns the user to the Homepage.
