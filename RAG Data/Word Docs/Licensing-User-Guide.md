## Chapter 1

# Getting started

This chapter gives you an overview of Idox Cloud Public Protection, and tells you how to log in and get the system set up the way you want it.



## About Idox Cloud Public Protection

Using Idox Cloud Public Protection, you can create and process case records relating to public protection in your local authority.

## Case records

You can create and process the following types of case records, in "modules" relating to the type of information recorded:

Premises

Licences

Service Requests

Accidents

Food Poisoning

Grants

Relating to these, you can record cases in other modules, which can be linked to the above, such as:

Inspections

Actions

Samples

Notices

Prosecutions

## Additional records

You can also record supporting records, such as:

Locations (properties) and contacts (people) in central records. Then when you want to include the location or contact details in a case, you just need to find and select them.

Administrator users can also maintain reference data and configure the system to work the way your authority needs.

For information about the administration functionality, see the Idox Cloud Public Protection Administration Guide.

## Other functionality

And you can:

Generate various reports relating to cases in the system.

Record details of committee meetings.

Record details of bookings for various events, such as appointments with Public Protection officers, driving or vehicle assessments, compliance checks, or DBS appointments.



## About the Licensing module

Using the Licensing module, you can record details of applications for licences such as for:

Licensing Act 2003

Gambling

Taxi Licensing

HMO Property Licensing

## Processing applications

Using the Licensing module and other related modules, you can record all parts of the application process. You can:

Create the application. You can do this manually from scratch, from an existing licence, or by processing an online submission.

This involves recording the basic details, recording conditions for the licence, and adding contacts, fees and payments.

Update and assess the application. This can involve:

Recording correspondence, in communication records and uploading files.

Recording consultations.

Recording bookings and inspections.

Recording actions taken.

Record the decision making process.

This can involve recording details of committee meeting hearings.

Record the granting and issuing of the licence. This turns the application record into a licence record, and it's given a licence number.

If a subsequent application - such as a minor variation, or a renewal application - is required, this will be a new standalone record linked to the original licence.

## Updating licences

You can also use the Licensing module to update licence records. For example, to record the revocation or suspension of a licence. Or there may be updates specific to the licence type, for example adding details of a street collection return or small society lottery draw.

You can also perform bulk updates for multiple licences, for example to generate reminder letters.



## Who can do what?

Idox Cloud Public Protection is designed to give authorities flexibility when deciding which types of users can access which areas of the system.

So you may find that if you're set up as an officer, you don't have access to the GDPR functionality. Or as a manager, you may not have permissions to create location records. However, this can be different for each authority.

This guide is intended for all end users of the system, so it may well cover functionality that you don't have access to.



## Accessing Idox Cloud Public Protection

You can access Idox Cloud Public Protection on any up-to-date web browser (we recommend no more than one version old).

Tip:	This section covers the standard login procedure. Your system may instead use:

Single-sign on, meaning you're logged in using your general local authority user account. To use this, type the sign-in name for your authority in the Username field, and then click away from the field.

Multi-factor authentication, meaning you need to provide further details after clicking the log in button.

## Logging in

Log in using your chosen web browser. On accessing Idox Cloud Public Protection, the login page is displayed.



To log in:

Type your Username and Password.

Tip:	If you've forgotten your password, you can reset it - see If you've forgotten your password.

Click the log in button.

You're taken to the home page. The details displayed depend on how your homepage is configured. See:

If lists of cases are displayed, see Case overview lists on page 16.

If graphs are displayed, see About the dashboard on page 19.

## Changing the display size

When you first log on, you may want to increase the display size of the system, to make the text easier to read. To do this, simply use the zoom controls in the browser. All pages you open in the system will be displayed at the zoom level you select.



### Logging out

You should always log out of Idox Cloud Public Protection when you're not using it, for example at the end of your shift or when going on a break.

To log out, click the Logout button next to your name in the top right of the page.





### If you've forgotten your password

If you've forgotten your password, you can reset it:

On the login page, click Forgotten your password? The Password Recovery page opens.



Type your username, and then click Submit. An email is sent to your email address.

[Please confirm the rest of this - I'm using SSO so can't check]

In the email, click the Reset Password link. A page is displayed prompting you to enter a new password.

Type a new password in the Password and Confirm Password fields, and then click SUBMIT.

You're now logged into the system.



## How Idox Cloud Public Protection is structured

## The homepage

When you first log in, the homepage is displayed. The information shown here depends on your user set up, but the structure of the page remains the same.



The top menu, providing access to functionality available throughout your session, for example to the various modules.

The name of the user you're currently logged in as. Clicking this opens your user profile so you can update it. Alongside your user name is a button for you to log out.

The main part of the page displays different details depending on your user setup. This could be:

A dashboard as in the above example, providing details of cases - see About the dashboard on page 19.

Sections listing cases you can access. These could either list the cases you're involved in, cases by officer, outstanding notices, or if you're a team leader, cases your team is involved in - see Case overview lists on page 16.

You can return to the home page at any time, by clicking the Home icon  in the top menu.

## Subsequent pages

Once you open a case from the home page, or select an option from the top menu, a new page is displayed.



This page will display:

The same top navigation and user profile options.

It will also show a menu down the left side of the page. This menu provides options relevant to the current element accessed. For example, if you selected Contacts from the top menu, it'll provide options relating to contact records.

Sometimes, there'll be one or more additional menus down the left hand side, specific to the type of record you're working with.

In case record menus, if there are details on the page a menu item links to, a tick will be displayed beside it.





### Case overview lists

Your user account may be set up to display lists of cases on the homepage. There are several different types which may be displayed.

## My Overview

The default view, this lists the modules you have access to in separate sections. Each section contains a number indicating how many "open" records you have which need your attention in the next 30 days (up to 100 records).

Open records are those without a completed or actual date, and for the Licence module, applications which haven't been turned into licences yet.



Clicking on a section lists the cases.



You can then click on a case to open it. Or you can click Print to print a list of your cases in that module.

Once you've recorded the completed date for a case, it will no longer be displayed in the list.

## Officers Overview

The Officers Overview view includes two different areas:

Online Submission: lists the licensing applications submitted online and received by Idox Cloud Public Protection. Clicking on a record opens its details. The role assigned to your user record will determine the licence types you'll have access to.



Officers: lists each officer in a separate section, with a summary of the number of each type of record assigned to them. Clicking + next to a summary displays a list of records which you can click on to open.



Licences Expired or Due to expire without Application: lists all licences that don't have an active application pending where the licence expiry date is either:

Up to two months in the past.

Up to one month in the past.



## Team Leaders Overview

Once configured, the Team Leaders Overview provides details of the cases assigned to members of your team.

On the left is an overview of the cases in modules you're associated with.

On the right is a list of your team members.



Clicking on the module for a team member provides a breakdown of their cases.



Clicking on a number in the breakdown lists the cases meeting that criterion.



You can then click on a case reference number to open it.

Note:	Only a user with Admin access can add people to your team list.



### About the dashboard

If the dashboard is configured for display on your homepage, this will include different widgets containing graphs or charts displaying near real time data.

You can configure the widgets to display, but there's common functionality throughout them.

## What you can do

From the dashboard, you can:

Click on the down arrow above a widget to display a menu where you can change the display of the widget. Depending on the widget, the menu will display some or all of these sections:

Click on a point or bar on a graph to view a list of the cases it relates to.



You can then click View next to a case to open it, or click Export to export the list of cases into an Excel spreadsheet.

Click the refresh button  to refresh the data on the dashboard.

Click the minus button - to collapse the widget. You can then click + to expand it.

Click x to remove the widget from the dashboard.

Rearrange the widgets - hold the mouse button down over a widget header, then drag it to the relevant place.

What you want displayed on your homepage.

Various defaults.

If you have the dashboard displaying on your homepage, you can configure how and what information is displayed.



### Changing your user details

## About your user details

It's important to keep your user details up to date. In particular:

Ensuring the correct email address is recorded, as this is used for password recovery and system-generated communication.

Regularly changing your password, as per your authority's security protocols.

Note:	When changing you password, it's recommended that any functionality for the web browser to remember password is disable, both for security and practical reasons.

## Making changes

Type your new password in the first Password field.

Type it again in the second Password field to confirm it.

Click Save.



### Configuring the dashboard

If your user profile is set up so the dashboard's displayed on your home page, you can configure it so it displays the information relevant to you.

To configure the dashboard the way you want it, click the configure button  on the dashboard. The Configure window opens. You can then change the details displayed as described in the following sections.

Notes:	If you decide you want to get rid of any changes you've made, you can click Reset to Default at the bottom of the Configure window at any time.

You can also configure the individual graph widgets to change the data they display, and the type of graph used. For more information, see About the dashboard on page 19.



#### Specifying who information will be displayed for

Tip:	On selecting a value in one of these fields, the fee for the application is updated on the right side of the page.



On the right side of the page, if any of the fee values you selected include multipliers, extra fields are displayed. Type the multiplier for the relevant fee(s) as appropriate.



If necessary, record any other fees in the Additional Fee field.

The fee totals are updated automatically, taking into account any fixed fee.

If the applicant only needs to pay a percentage of the fees on initial application, the Initial Application Invoice amount is also displayed.

The Outstanding Balance field shows the total of fees outstanding. This will be reduced when you record payment details - see Recording a payment on page 86.

If the licence includes an annual fee, on the left side of the page, select the Annual Fee Month, and then type the Annual Fee amount.

Tip:	This amount isn't included in the total fee calculation.

If this licence type has the capability to upload plans, in the Plans field, click Choose file, and then browse for and select a file to attach.

Note:	You can only upload .pdf, .jpg, .jpeg, .png, and .gif file types. Only the first page of a PDF file will be uploaded.

Click Save. The licence record is saved, and the Licence Description, Licence Type, and Application Type can no longer be changed.

If the licence type allows additional licence holders, to record these:

Next to the Additional Proposed Licence Holder(s) field, click the Search button.

Search for and select the relevant contact record on the system. On selecting the individual, their details are listed below the Search button.

Repeat these steps to add further individuals as required.

## After clicking Save

After you click Save:

An Application Number and Licence Number are generated automatically, and extra tabs are displayed relevant to the licence type.



A Licence Application menu is displayed on the left of the page. This provides access to further functionality relating to the application.



You can now record further details about the application.

## Creating an application from an existing licence

## About creating applications from licences

If appropriate, you can create a licence application based on an existing licence. This would be useful if you're creating a transfer or variation, for example.

When you create an application from an existing licence, you can opt to copy the key details across from the licence record. This saves you time and ensures these details are recorded correctly. When the new application is created:

A unique application number is generated, but the licence number is copied over.

Prerequisite and consultation records will be copied across, but won't be populated.

Any licence conditions won't be copied across.

The Manage Licence Numbers and History tab will be populated with details of the existing licence.

Notes:	If the application is a transfer or variation which will be going to online consultation, you may instead choose not to copy existing data across. Doing this will ensure that only the "new" information in the application will be displayed for Council Direct users to provide representations about. You can then copy the existing data across once consultation is complete - see Copying details from the parent licence on page 72.

Separate functionality is available for creating renewal applications. For more information, see Creating renewal reminders and applications on page 213.

## Creating an application

To create a licence application from an existing licence:

## Chapter 3

# Updating licence applications

Once an application is in progress, you'll need to update it at various points before a decision can be made. This chapter covers tasks you'll need to carry out.

## What this chapter doesn't cover

The chapter doesn't cover functionality you may also use at other times when processing applications and licences, such as recording:

Invoices and payments - see Recording fee invoices and payments on page 84.

The completion of prerequisites - see Recording completion of prerequisites on page 89.

Consultations, inspections, notices, bookings, and actions. For details of these, see Consultation and investigation on page 117.

##### Internal editor tips

These tips may be useful when using the internal editor:

If you find you can't type in the template when you first open it, click the Source button once, and then click it again.

To make it easier to work with the template, you can click the maximise button . This will make the editor take up the whole of the browser window.

Clicking it again will return you to the initial view.

As the editor is contained in a browser, you can't use the Tab key to indent text. This will just move to the next field in the window. Instead, use the increase indent  and decrease indent  buttons.

The editor doesn't have:

A way of including headers and footer areas. If you need these, it's recommended you set the template up in Word.

Rulers. Instead, either use the indent keys to format text, or add the text in a table. This may also be useful for defining headers and footers.

When pasting information from other sources, such as Word:

It's recommended you use the option to paste as plain text, to ensure hidden formatting elements aren't brought across.

Some complex tables may need reformatting to display correctly within the editor.

By default, a carriage return creates a large space (paragraph break) between lines. To create a smaller single-line space, use Ctrl+Enter keys together.

To add an image to a template:

It's recommended you add a URL linking to the image, for example so you use the authority logo image on the authority website. This will ensure the image is updated in line with the authority website.

Alternatively, you can add images into the template itself, but these will have to be added to the editor folder on the server.

You can use the page break button  to add a page break, which will be used when printing the document.



#### Sending a communication as an email

## Chapter 4

# Consultation and investigation

This chapter covers the tasks you may need to perform when:

Consulting on an application, including online consultation.

Performing inspections, whether this is during the application assessment or after the licence has been issued.

Performing tasks relating to inspections, such as recording actions, prosecutions, and notices.



## Recording consultations

When consulting on an application, the process involves:

Specifying the consultees. Some consultees are added automatically, for example from neighbour consultations on the map. You can also manually add further consultees by linking to contact records - see Adding consultees to an application on page 117.

Notifying the consultees about the consultation. Depending on whether the contact record for a consultee contains an email address, you can either send an email consultation, or create a communication to print and send - see Notifying consultees on page 118.

If the application is displayed on Council Direct, consultee comments may be automatically received from there and saved on the Consultations page. Otherwise, you can record these as they're received - see Processing representations on page 122.

Reviewing the comments received, and optionally setting them to display on Council Direct - see Making a representation public on page 125.



### Adding consultees to an application

Tip:	Before adding a consultee, it's a good idea to check whether there's a contact record for them first, by going to the Contacts area in the top menu. If there isn't, create one before adding them as a consultee - see Creating a contact record on page 223. This ensures there are no issues saving the contact.

To manually add consultees to an application, with the application open on the Licence Application Edit page:

Select the Consultees tab. Any existing consultees are listed.

Click the Add button. A blank row is added.



Click the Contact button.

Search for and select the relevant contact record on the system - see Searching for records on page 232. On selecting the individual, their details are listed in the Contact field.

Tip:	If you search by email address, this will ensure that you select a contact with an email address recorded. This will make notifying the consultee easier.

Repeat steps 3 and 4 to add further consultees as required.

Click Save.

Note:	You won't be able to notify the consultees you added until you've saved your changes.

You can now send notifications of the consultation to the consultees.



### Notifying consultees

## About sending notifications

Once consultees have been saved to the Consultees tab, a URL field will be added to each consultee record. This provides a link to the consultation on Council Direct. You can include this link in the communication you send to the consultee.



For each consultee with an email addressed associated with their contact record, you can notify them of the consultation by sending a notification email, as described below.

For all other consultees, you'll need to:

Manually record the Date Referred To and Target Response Date on the Consultees tab. For information on recording dates, see Populating fields on page 235.

Create a communication to send to them informing them of the consultation. This should use the consultation template set up for the licence type, which must be an internal editor template.

For general information on creating a communication to send, see Creating a communication on page 94.

## Sending email notifications

To send email notifications to the consultees for the application, on the Consultees tab:

Select the Notification checkbox next to each consultee you want to notify.

Click the Send Notification button. The notification window is displayed, showing the files attached to the application and options for the email.

To include any other files, select the file(s) in Windows Explorer and drag them into the Drag File Here area on the window. Each file is added to the list on the right.

Tip:	Any files you add will be attached to the application as uploaded files.

To change the design of the email, select the relevant Email Brand.

From the Email Reply To field, select the address the email will be addressed from, and so which replies will be sent to.

Click Send Email Notification, then click OK on the message displayed.

The Date Referred To is set to today's date. For standard consultees, the Target Response Date is also populated based on the configuration for the licence type.



If any consultees were added to the application manually, in the Target Response Date field, record the date by which they must respond to the consultation for their comments to be considered. For information on recording dates, see Populating fields on page 235.

Click Save.

A communication record is added for the notification.

## Recording initiatives

## About initiatives

Using the Initiatives module, you can send out correspondences in bulk. For example, this may be for an alert on a product, or to send renewal reminders to licence holders.

In initiative records, you create the correspondence using initiative templates configured in the system. Depending on the template, the correspondence will either be a letter to be emailed/printed, or a text message sent to a mobile phone.

## How to use initiatives to send correspondence

To create and send an initiative, you:

Create the initiative record and record the basic details - see Creating an initiative on page 200.

Select the premises, licence records, or locations that the initiative will be sent to - see Selecting initiative recipients on page 202.

For initiatives relating to letters:

Use the merge document functionality to generate, edit and print the letters. The way you do this depends on the type of communication template related to the initiative type.

For templates created in Word, see Editing, generating, and downloading letters created in Word on page 203.

For templates created in the internal editor, see Printing letters using the internal editor on page 204.

If the initiative is linked to premises or licences, send the merged documents as emails if required - see Emailing initiative details on page 205.

Note:	You can't email initiatives linked to locations.

If sending printed letters for an initiative linked to premises or locations, generate and print the address labels - see Printing address labels on page 205.

Note:	You can't bulk generate labels for initiatives linked to licences.

For initiatives relating to text messages, use the merge document functionality to select recipients and send the messages - see Sending text message initiatives on page 207.

## Once the initiative has been sent out

After the initiative correspondences has been sent, you can:

Create inspection records for the related cases, if this is required for the initiative type - see Creating inspections from an initiative on page 209.

Upload files, as you would for licence records. For more information, see Managing uploaded files on page 106.

Create a "chain" initiative relating to the current initiative. Doing this means you can set correspondences to not be sent if a specified action has already been complete - see Creating a chain initiative on page 211.

View and edit the initiative details from the licence record. From here, you can record the response received from the recipient, and schedule inspections if needed - see Editing an initiative from a licence record on page 212.



### Creating an initiative

To create an initiative record:

From the top menu, select Initiatives .

From the Initiatives left menu, select Create Initiative. The Create Initiative page opens.



Add the following details:

To record the time spent on the initiative, populate the details in the Time Accounting section in the same manner as for inspections - see Recording the time spent on an inspection on page 141.

Click Save. A message is displayed stating that the initiative has been created.

The initiative record remains on screen so you can select the records to link it to.



### Selecting initiative recipients

## About initiative recipients

Before generating the correspondence to send, you need to select the recipients of the correspondence. You can either select premises records, licence records, or location records.

Notes:	It's recommended that you only choose one type of record as the recipient for an initiative - for example, licence records only.

If the initiative is of an initiative type relating to text messages, you cannot select locations as recipients.

## Selecting recipients

To select the recipients of an initiative, with the initiative record open:

From the left Initiative Details menu, select the option relevant to the record type you want to select recipients from:

Select Premises.

Select Locations.

Select Licences.

The search page for the record type is displayed.

Search for the records to send the initiative to. For information about searching, see Searching for records by specifying search criteria on page 231.

The records matching your criteria are displayed on the left side of the results section of the page.



To select the records to send the message to:

Select the right arrow > next to each required record.

Click the Select All button to select all listed records.

The records you select are moved to the right side of the results section.

On navigating to another page, the relevant Select... option in the Initiative Details menu has a tick added.



Selecting this option will list the records that have already been selected as recipients, in right side of the results list. You can also repeat the above steps to add further recipients to the list.



You can now generate the correspondence.



### Editing, generating, and downloading letters created in Word

## About initiatives using templates created in Word

If the initiative type uses a template created in Microsoft Word, on selecting Merge Document in the Initiative Details left menu, the Merged Document page lists the potential recipients from the linked records, along with several buttons.



## What you can do

For individual recipients, you can:

Click the left Open button to open the document in Word. You can then make changes to the letter for their version only, and save the changes back to the system.

For more information on this process, see Viewing and editing a communication document on page 97.

When the changes are saved back to the system, a PDF is automatically generated for the document.

Click the right Open button to download a PDF of the letter. You can only do this if a PDF has already been generated.

After selecting the checkbox next to one or more recipients, for all selected recipients you can then:

Click Generate/Re-Generate Selected to regenerate the Word document attached to the recipient record using the default template configuration. [I'm getting "failed to generate" messages for both generate/regenerate buttons - any idea why?]

This refreshes the content of the Word document(s) attached to the recipient record(s), and so will undo any changes you've made.

Click Generate/Re-Generate Selected PDFs to regenerate the PDF attached to the recipient record(s).

You'd do this to ensure the PDF has the same contents as the Word document, for example after clicking the Generate/Re-Generate Selected button.

Click Download Selected to download PDFs for the selected recipients, ready for printing. [I keep getting an error after clicking this button - any idea why?]

Once downloaded, you can then send the PDFs to the required printer.



### Printing letters using the internal editor

## About initiatives using internal editor templates

If the initiative type uses a template created in the internal editor, on selecting Merge Document in the Initiative Details left menu, the Merged Document page displays the document in the editor.



From here, you can check the letter and print it for all recipients.

## Generating and printing letters

To generate and print letters, on the Merged Document page:

Check the content in the editor.

Click the Print button  in the internal editor toolbar, not in the browser, then print to the required printer.

Letters for all recipients are printed in a single document.



### Printing address labels

## About merging labels

If the initiative is linked to premises or locations, to enable you to print the address labels for the initiative in bulk, you can use the Merge Labels functionality.

Note:	This functionality is not available for initiatives linked to licence records.

This functionality creates a Word document containing the addresses of all location or premises records linked to the initiative.

## Merging and printing labels

To print the address labels for an initiative:

In the Initiative Details left menu, select Merge Labels. A message is displayed asking whether you want to print labels for locations or premises.



Click Locations or Premises as appropriate depending on whether the initiative is linked to location or premises records. The Save As window opens.

Save the Word document to an appropriate location.

Once the document has downloaded, open and print it in Word.

Click the Send button. The text messages are sent.

On the Merged Document page, a tick is displayed next to each recipient you selected. Additionally, an Initiative SMS History button is displayed - you can use this to view details of the SMS sent.





### Creating inspections from an initiative

## About creating inspections

If the initiative is of a type requiring an inspection, a Create Inspections option is displayed in the Initiative Details left menu. Using this, you can create inspections for all premises or licence records linked to the initiative.

Once created, you can update the inspection details from the premises or licence - see Editing an initiative from a licence record on page 212.

## Creating inspections

To create inspections from an initiative:

In the Initiative Details left menu, select Create Inspections. The Create an Inspection page opens.



The initiative shouldn't have both premises and licences linked - however, if it has, select whether to create inspections for premises or licences.

Add the following details:

Click Save. The inspections are created against the licence records, and you're returned to the Edit Initiative page.

For information about progressing the inspection records, see Recording inspections on page 134.



### Creating a chain initiative

## About chain initiatives

By setting up a "chain" of initiatives, you can set messages to not be sent if a specified action has already been completed.

To do this, you create an initiative from an existing initiative, and then specify a "termination action". If this action has been recorded against the licence record, the correspondence will not be generated and sent for that licence record.

## Creating a chain

To create a chain initiative, with the existing initiative open:

In the Initiative Details left menu, select Chain. The Chain Initiatives page lists any existing chain initiatives.

Click Add. New initiative details are displayed, based on those for the existing initiative.



Amend any of the existing details if required.

From the Termination Action list, select the action which, if it's been completed against a licence record, will prevent the initiative being sent.

Click Save.

The Chain Initiatives page is updated to list the new chain initiative. To view the initiative, click on the Initiative No.

The licence records from the original initiative are linked automatically, but the correspondence will not be sent for cases where the termination action has been recorded.



### Editing an initiative from a licence record

## Initiatives available from licence records

Once an initiative has been linked to a licence record, you can access it from within the licence record. From there, you can add response details and if necessary schedule an inspection, specific to the licence record.

## Editing an initiative

To edit an initiative from within a licence record:

In the Associated Records left menu, select Initiatives. The initiatives linked to the licence record are listed.

Click on the Initiative No. of the initiative you want to open. The Edit Initiative page is displayed.

## Creating renewal reminders and applications

When a licence is due for renewal, there are two ways to generate renewal reminders and renewal applications. Depending on your local procedures, you may need to:

Use the Renewals option in the Licences left menu. Doing this will create both renewal reminders and applications automatically. This method is recommended if you are not using the Council Direct online portal.

For more details, see Using the Renewals menu option on page 213.

Create a mailing initiative to generate reminders for licence records you select. This method is recommended if you are using the Council Direct online portal.

Note:	For this functionality to work, your administrator must have configured an initiative type for this purpose.

Doing this will not automatically create a renewal application. If a renewal is required:

The licence holder can create a renewal application online, if a "renewal" application type has been set up to display online.

You can record details in the system. Depending on the licence type configuration, you may be able to do this by clicking the Renew button on the existing licence record.

For more details about creating and sending initiatives, see Recording initiatives on page 199.



### Using the Renewals menu option

## About the Renewals option

Using the Renewals option in the Licences left menu, you can batch print renewal reminder letters and automatically create renewal applications for selected licences.

You do this by searching for and selecting the licences you want to generate renewals for, and then printing the reminder letters. These are generated into a single PDF, and the system automatically creates a renewal application record for each licence you select. You can then update the application record when the required details are received from the applicant.

Note:	You cannot use this method to generate email reminders.

## Generating reminder letters and renewals

To generate reminder letters and renewal applications for licences:

From the Licences left menu, select Renewals. The Licence Record Search Renewals page opens.

Add retrieval criteria and click Search to search for matching licences. For information on searching, see Searching for records on page 232.

The licences matching your criteria are listed. [what determines whether a licence is retrieved? Not all of my licences appear in the results]



Select the checkbox for each licence you want to print renewal reminders for. Or to select all licences, select the checkbox in the column heading.

Click the Print button. A message is displayed warning that licence applications will be generated for the licences.



Click OK.

A print window is displayed. Change any settings as required, then click Print.

The details of the reminder are displayed in a preview window. Close this when you're done.

For each licence record you selected, a new application is created. Any information held on the Additional Licence Data and licence specific tabs is copied over to the renewal record. You can now search for the applications and update them as you would any other application record.



## Reporting

[info to follow. Might need to go in its own chapter/guide]





## Chapter 7

# Creating central records

When you're processing cases, you'll need to record details of locations and individuals related to the case. These details are stored centrally, which saves having to enter the details from scratch manually. This chapter explains how to create these central records.

## Retrieving, editing, and deleting central records

You can also search for central records and then edit or delete them - for information on doing this, see Common functionality on page 229.



## Maintaining location and street records

Location records contain details of the properties you may need to select when recording details throughout the system - for example when creating a licence record, or when creating a contact record. Each location record is associated with the street record for the street it's located in.

Most location and street records are created externally, and imported into the system in a DTF (data transfer format) import.

For these types of records, you cannot edit the key details, or delete the record. You can, however, add related details to location records as described below.

You can also create location and street records manually. You may need to do this so you can reference locations which are outside of the local authority's area. For information, see Creating a location record for an address outside the authority's area on page 216.

You can edit and delete these records.

Tip:	You can retrieve manually-created locations and streets by selecting the Non DTF Only checkbox on the relevant search page.

## Adding related details to location records

Similar to the way you add them to licence records, you can add these secondary details to location records:

Notes. For more information about notes, see Adding notes to an application on page 111.

Additional contacts. For more information about these, see Recording additional contacts on page 83.

Uploaded files. For more information about these, see Managing uploaded files on page 106.

## Merging records

If two records have been created on the system for the same location or street, you can merge them - see:

Merging location records on page 220.

Merging street records on page 221.



### Creating a location record for an address outside the authority's area

There are times when you'll need to link a record to an address that's not included in your authority's official LLPG database. For example:

If a fly tipping complaint relates to a stretch of road just outside the authority's boundary, but is on a shared road from one authority to another.

For a mobile street trader from another area.

When this is the case, you'll need to create the address manually as follows:

Create the street record for the street the property is located on - see Creating a street record on page 216.

Create the location record, linking it to the street record - see Creating a location record on page 217.

Note:	Before creating a street or location record, check that there isn't already a record for it on the system. To do this, search for the street or location, adding minimal retrieval criteria (so you don't accidentally filter out the relevant record). For general information about searching, see Searching for records on page 232.



#### Creating a street record

To create a street record:

From the top menu, select Locations .

From the Streets left menu, select Create Street.

## Chapter 8

# Common functionality

This chapter includes useful information on using functionality throughout the system. This includes an overview of how to populate the different types of field you'll find in the system, and how to use the map.



## Navigating around the system

Here are some tips about how to navigate around the system.

## Using page controls, not browser buttons

Idox Cloud Public Protection uses page controls, such as menus, icons, Save or Cancel buttons, and links to other areas. You should use these to navigate around the system, rather than using your browser's back and forward buttons.

Note:	As with any web page where a transaction or data editing is taking place, using the browser's back and forward buttons can in very rare circumstances cause data duplication or corruption.

You can also use the breadcrumb link at the top left of each page to navigate around the system.



## Opening multiple records

If you want to have several records open, or have different areas of the system open at the same time, you can do this easily.

Instead of clicking on a link in the system, just right-click and select Open link in new tab.



## Tabbing from field to field

When entering details into fields, you can use the Tab key on your keyboard to move from field to field as an alternative to using the mouse. By holding the Shift key while pressing Tab you can move in reverse order between fields.



## Useful browser functionality

As Idox Cloud Public Protection is a web-based system, some of the standard functionality available in your browser may be extremely useful when using the system. While functionality and commands vary between browsers, these options may include:

Checking spelling: the spell checker automatically underlines incorrect spellings with a red line, enabling you to correct these manually.

Printing: to print a web page using the browser's print functionality, you can normally access this by pressing Ctrl and P on your keyboard, although this may vary by browser.

Finding text: use the find functionality to search for a term. This is particularly useful when navigating through pages of search results. For most browsers, you can access the find functionality by pressing Ctrl and F.

## Retrieving records

There are several ways you can retrieve records throughout the system:

For all module records, plus for contact and location fields throughout the system, there is a Search option. This lets you specify retrieval criteria to search for and return records of that type. For full details, see Searching for records by specifying search criteria on page 231.

For all module records, the associated left menu has a View option. Clicking this lists all cases. You can page through the list, and click on a case to open it.

You can also retrieve licence records from your homepage:

If the dashboard is displayed on your homepage, you can select a licence record if it's listed in a widget. For information on the dashboard, see About the dashboard on page 19.

If your homepage is set to display case overview lists, you can click on a licence record in a list to open it. For information on case lists, see Case overview lists on page 16.

Selecting them from your Recently Viewed list - see Opening a recently viewed case on page 234.



### Searching for records by specifying search criteria

Throughout the system, you can search for records by specifying search criteria. This could be when searching for cases, or when searching for contacts, locations, or other cases to link to a case.

In Licensing, there are search options available in the left menus for Online Applications, Applications, Licences, and Licence Committees.

## Search results

When the results are displayed in a list, depending on where you are, clicking on a record will:

Open the case record.

Select the record for linking to the current case - for example, when adding contact details.

Additionally:

For most searches, you can export the list of results, for example for reporting purposes.

For case record searches, you can save the search criteria for reuse another time - see Rerunning a saved search on page 233.



#### Using wildcards when searching

When searching strings of text, the system automatically appends a wildcard to the end of a search term. This means the system would find everything that begins with the search term, no matter what comes next.

So, for example, if you searched for John Street:

It would return "John Street Bakery, Johnstown, JS88 H45".

It wouldn't return "Bakery at John Street, Johnstown, JS88 H45".

To find this, you'd have to add a wildcard, and search for %John Street. You can do this when specifying partial words, as well as whole words, for example %oh.



#### Searching for records

To search for records:

Open the Search page by:

Selecting the relevant Search option from the left menu.

Clicking the Search button next to the relevant field.

Depending on the search page, several tabs or expandable sections may be displayed. This image shows an example.



To narrow down the search, type values or select items in the fields displayed. You can specify details in as many fields as you like.

For example, you could search for a specific record type, select the officer from the Officer Name field, and specify From and To dates.

Tips:	Don't forget, you can specify partial search terms, and use wildcards if you need to - see Using wildcards when searching on page 232.

For information about populating different types of fields, such as date fields, see Populating fields on page 235.

If you want to save the specified search criteria for future use:

Click the Save Search button. A new window is displayed.



Give the search a Name and a Description, and click Save Search.

A message is displayed confirming that the search has been saved. Click x in the top right corner of the window to close it.

Click the Search button. The records matching the retrieval criteria are listed in the bottom part of the page.



If a large number of records are returned, navigation links will be displayed above and below the first set of records. Use these links to view further records.



Do one of the following:

To open a record, click on it.

If the search page gives you the option to export the results, select the Open in Excel  or Open in Word  button as appropriate.

If you're searching for a contact or location to link to a case and the record you want doesn't exist, you can create it. Click the Create button and create the record as described in Creating a contact record on page 223.

When performing a case search, you can also save the search for reuse later.



#### Rerunning a saved search

When searching for cases, if you're likely to perform the same search several times, you can save the search when you first run it - see Searching for records on page 232.

## Rerunning a saved search

Once you've saved a search, to rerun it:

In the relevant left menu, select Saved Searches. The My Saved Searches page opens, listing the searches you've saved in this area.



To filter the searches listed, start typing the name of the search in the Filter by Name field. The list filters as you type.

To undo the filter, click the Reset button.

To rerun a search, click the Search button next to it.

## Deleting a saved search

To delete a search, on the My Saved Searches page, click the Delete button next to it. Then click OK when prompted.

## Updating a saved search

To update a saved search:

Run the saved search.

Edit the search criteria as required.

Click the Save Search button.

If necessary, update the Name and Description.

Click Update Search.

A message is displayed confirming that the saved search has been updated. Click x in the top right corner of the window to close it.

## Working with records

This section includes tips about working with records once you've created or retrieved them.



### Populating fields

There are several types of fields you'll come across in the system - these are explained below.

## Standard text fields

Standard text fields are displayed with a white background and black border. When you add details to these, the information will be saved as unformatted text.



## Formatted text fields

Some fields contain a toolbar with options to format the text and paragraph. When you add details to these, any formatting you apply will be kept. This is useful when including field details in communications, for example.



## Single selection list fields

If a field has a down arrow to its right, a list will be displayed when you click on it. You can select a single value from the list.



Tip:	If there are a lot of items in the list, start typing the value you want to find - this will filter the list to match the details you're typing.



## Multiple selection list fields

When you click in a multiple selection list field, a list will be displayed. When you select an item from the list, it'll be added to the field. You can repeat this as many times as required.



Tip:	As with single selection lists, if there are a lot of items in the list, start typing the value you want to find - this will filter the list to match the details you're typing.



## Single date fields

To populate a date field, you can click in it and:

Select the date from the calendar displayed.



To insert today's date, either type t and then press the Tab key, or click on the field and hit the Enter key.

Type the date in the format dd-mm-yyyy.

## Mandatory fields

Mandatory fields are displayed with a red asterisk against them. If you attempt to save a record without populating a mandatory field, a message is displayed stating that it's mandatory.



## Display-only fields

Some fields are calculated automatically, and display-only. These are displayed without a background or border around the field value.





### Adding, saving, and deleting records

When you're creating or editing a record, a set of buttons will normally be displayed at the bottom of the page. The buttons displayed will be dependent on the permissions set for your user. If the edit buttons aren't available, speak to your system administrator.



If a Save button is displayed, you must select it to save your changes. If no Save button is displayed, the system will auto-save.

Clicking Cancel will cancel any changes you've made, and return you to whichever page you were previously on.

The Delete button will only be displayed if you have deletion rights for the record. On clicking this button, you'll be prompted to confirm that you want to delete the record.

You may also find an Add button on some pages. Where this is displayed, you'll need to click on it to add a secondary record - often, this will take you to a new tab in your browser.



### Recorded changes

In various places throughout the system, on saving changes to a case, you may be prompted to record details of your change. This ensures that an audit history of the key changes to the case is kept.

## Recording change details

To record details of a change:

Click Save. The Recorded Change window opens.



Select the Recorded Change Type, and then in the Comments field, type the reason for the change. Then click Save.

On the Prerequisites tab, if you recorded a note against a prerequisite, a Show Note button is displayed. Clicking this shows the note as you recorded it.



## Viewing recorded changes

To view the recorded changes for a case:

From the Licence Application left menu, select Recorded Changes. Below the summary information for the case, the recorded changes are listed.



To view further details of a change, click on it.





## Using the map

For licence records within Idox Cloud Public Protection, you can display a map to view, create, and edit features relating to the area covered by the record.

The displayed map will be composed of several layers, which determine the information that is displayed on the map. This allows you to view Ordnance Survey (OS) features, such as buildings, property boundaries and roads along with specific detail relating to cases in the current module, for example, polygons representing the areas of planning applications.

As well as creating features for records, you can also perform a spatial analysis of the underlying data for features covered by an area you specify.

#### Copying an existing map feature

## About copying features

You can create a map feature for a licence record by copying an existing feature. When doing this:

You can only copy features from the map layers listed under the Layers option in the Display menu.

You can either select a feature directly from the map, or from the list displayed when you perform a spatial analysis.

You can only copy a single feature at a time. However, after saving your changes, you can repeat the process to add further features.

## Copying a feature

To copy an existing feature from the map:

Display the feature on the map. To do this, you may need to:

Ensure the map layer containing the feature is displayed.

Tip:	You can only select a layer from the Layers option from the Display menu.

For information on displaying map layers, see Changing what's displayed on the map on page 242.

Change the map location so the feature's shown - see Changing the location displayed on the map on page 241.

Do one of the following:

Click on the feature you want to copy.



Perform a spatial analysis of the features on the map, and select the feature from the list.

## Appendix A

# How do I...?

This appendix explains how to deal with different scenarios you may come across when working with licence and application records.

[please add any scenarios you think would be useful here]



## Deal with two concurrent applications relating to the same licence

## Using a "deemed granted" status to deal with two applications

Using Idox Cloud Public Protection, there must only ever be one active application record against a licence. However, there are times where there may be two different types of application against a licence. While only one application can be active, consultations may be required on both.

For example, if a premises alcohol licence was being transferred to a new licence holder, you may find that the Designated Premises Supervisor (DPS) was changing as well. Depending on your local procedures, each of these may require a separate application record.

To deal with this, you'd select one as being deemed granted. While this application would no longer be regarded as "open", it would still be kept available for consultation.

## Processing the two applications

To process two applications relating to the same licence, you'd:

Open the original licence record and, on the Licence History page, check that there aren't any active applications for the licence - see Viewing historical licence details on page 195.

Create the first application from the original licence record, or if it's an online submission, link it to the original licence - see Registering licence applications on page 27.

Until the second application is received, process the first application as normal, for example sending it out for consultation - see Recording consultations on page 117.

If the second application is received before a decision is made on the first, update the first application to set it as a "deemed granted" licence:

Open the original licence record and, on the Licence History page, click on the application to open it.

Ensure all prerequisites have been met, a see "Recording completion of prerequisites" on page 89nd all fees paid - see Recording completion of prerequisites on page 89 and Recording fee invoices and payments on page 84 respectively.

On the Licence tab, select the Status which relates to "deemed granted".

Insert today's date in the Issued Date field. For information on recording dates, see Populating fields on page 235.

Click Save, and then when prompted, click Issue as is.

The application is turned into the deemed granted licence.

Update the register details for the licence, to ensure it's displayed on Council Direct - Making a consultation public on page 119.

As the consultation will remain open, this licence record can still be updated with consultee comments until the consultation period has finished.

Create the second application from the deemed granted licence, or if it's an online submission, link it to the deemed granted licence.

You can then process this application as normal, sending it out for consultation as well.



## Process annual fees

## About annual fees for licences which don't expire

Some licence types - such as premises licences - don't expire, but instead require payment of an annual fee to remain active.

The recommended process for dealing with these is:

In the Initiatives module, create an initiative to generate reminders that the annual fee payment is required, selecting the licences this is required for.

For more details about creating and sending initiatives, see Recording initiatives on page 199.

Tip:	When doing this, export the list of licences to Word or Excel, to enable monitoring of payment. See below for more details.

The method for paying the fee will differ from authority to authority. You might:

Have a dedicated phone line, and the person taking the call would mark the licence record as being paid.

Provide licence holders with a link to your payment provider, and the finance department would notify you when payment has been made.

The most efficient way is to direct customers to Council Direct to pay their annual fee.

See below for further details about this.

## Annual fee payments through Council Direct

Note:	For this functionality to work, your administrator must have configured an application type for this purpose.

To receive annual fee payments through Council Direct:

Licence holders create an "annual fee" application on Council Direct, paying the fee at this time.

The online submission can then be accepted into the system, thereby creating an application for it - see Receiving online licence application submissions on page 73.

You'd then perform the standard steps for transforming the application into a licence record, granting the application - see Recording the granting of an application on page 185.

When doing this, you're prompted as to whether to copy data from the existing licence. Select Copy Data and select the details to copy into the new licence. For general information about copying parent data, see Copying details from the parent licence on page 72.

On saving, the previous licence record becomes inactive, and the annual fee licence record replaces it as the active licence record.

The previous licence record will be removed from the online register. If your council uses the online registers, ensure the online details section is completed on the new annual fee licence record. The register will then display the record and as much of the specific information as configured in your system.

## Monitoring unpaid annual fees

It's recommended that when using the Initiatives module to send reminders, you use the export functionality to export the list of licences selected to Excel or Word. As annual fees are received through Council Direct, the entries in this export can then be marked as paid. This gives you a list of businesses you need to follow up about non-payment.
