## Complete Workflow

### Starting a Food Poisoning Investigation

#### Incident Report Receipt and Initial Assessment
Food poisoning reports typically arrive through multiple channels including direct patient contact, medical practitioners, hospital notifications, or public health authority referrals. Each report receives a unique food poisoning number for tracking throughout the investigation process. Initial assessment determines whether the incident involves individual cases or potential outbreak situations requiring coordinated response.

#### Case Type Classification and Resource Planning
The system distinguishes between alleged individual cases and confirmed group outbreaks requiring different investigation approaches and resource allocation. Alleged cases involve single individuals reporting illness possibly linked to food consumption. Group or confirmed cases involve multiple patients with similar symptoms suggesting common source exposure requiring outbreak investigation protocols.

#### Patient Information Recording and Medical Details
Comprehensive patient information includes personal details, contact information, medical practitioner details, and onset symptoms. Date of birth, occupation, and health protection zone details support epidemiological analysis and risk assessment. General practitioner information enables medical liaison and clinical information sharing where appropriate for investigation purposes.

### Data Collection and Validation

#### Clinical and Epidemiological Information
Core medical information includes symptom onset dates, illness duration, and clinical presentation details. Infectious disease classification helps identify causative organisms and informs investigation approach. Case type categorization distinguishes between suspected, probable, and confirmed cases based on clinical and laboratory evidence.

#### Food Consumption History and Exposure Assessment
Detailed food consumption history identifies potential sources of infection including meal details, food sources, and consumption timing. Business premises information links cases to food establishments enabling targeted investigation and source identification. Multiple premises may be involved requiring coordinated assessment across different businesses.

#### Contact and Communication Management
Patient contact details enable ongoing communication throughout investigation process. Preferred contact methods ensure appropriate liaison while respecting patient privacy and confidentiality. Medical practitioner information supports clinical coordination and laboratory result communication.

#### Investigation Planning and Coordination
Officer assignment considers specialist expertise in food safety, infectious disease investigation, and epidemiological assessment. Response methods track investigation approaches including telephone interviews, premises visits, and collaborative working with public health teams. Resource planning ensures adequate investigation capacity for complex outbreak situations.

### Processing and Business Logic

#### Risk Assessment and Investigation Prioritization
The system prioritizes investigations based on severity, patient numbers, infectious agent, and public health risk. Individual cases receive appropriate investigation while group outbreaks trigger enhanced response including urgent premises inspection, sample collection, and public health authority notification. Resource allocation ensures effective investigation within available capacity.

#### Investigation Coordination and Evidence Gathering
Investigation activities are coordinated across multiple disciplines including environmental health officers, microbiologists, epidemiologists, and public health specialists. Evidence gathering includes patient interviews, premises inspections, sample collection, and food source tracing. Investigation notes track progress and findings throughout the process.

#### Integration with Related Modules
Food poisoning investigations automatically trigger related activities including premises inspections, food sample collection, and potential enforcement actions. Investigation findings inform business compliance assessment and may result in formal notices, license reviews, or prosecution procedures. Sample results provide laboratory confirmation supporting investigation conclusions.

### Outcomes and Next Steps

#### Investigation Findings and Cause Identification
Investigation outcomes record whether food poisoning reports are substantiated by evidence and investigation findings. Cause identification may include specific food items, business premises, or preparation failures leading to illness. Negative investigations record absence of food poisoning evidence supporting accurate statistical reporting and resource management.

#### Public Health Actions and Community Protection
Substantiated cases may require immediate public health actions including business closure, product withdrawal, or public warnings. The system tracks these actions ensuring appropriate response to protect community health. Follow-up monitoring verifies effectiveness of control measures and prevents ongoing transmission.

#### Business Compliance and Enforcement Actions
Investigation findings may trigger formal enforcement actions including improvement notices, prohibition orders, or prosecution procedures. The system links food poisoning investigations to enforcement activities providing complete case documentation for legal proceedings. Business compliance monitoring ensures sustained improvement following investigation.

#### Statistical Reporting and Performance Monitoring
Investigation statistics support national surveillance systems and local performance monitoring. Case numbers, causative organisms, and investigation outcomes contribute to food safety intelligence and policy development. Performance indicators measure investigation timeliness, success rates, and resource effectiveness.

## Data Management

## Integration Points

### Connection with Premises and Business Records
Food poisoning investigations are linked to business premises records providing immediate access to registration details, inspection history, and compliance information. Investigation findings update premise risk assessments and may trigger enhanced monitoring or enforcement actions. Business compliance patterns inform investigation prioritization and prevention strategies.

### Inspection and Enforcement Integration
Investigation findings automatically trigger premises inspections to assess food safety compliance and identify potential causes of illness. Inspection outcomes may result in enforcement actions including improvement notices, closure orders, or prosecution procedures. Integration ensures coordinated response and complete case documentation.

### Sample Collection and Laboratory Coordination
Food poisoning investigations often require sample collection from patients, food items, and business premises for laboratory analysis. The system coordinates sample requests, tracks laboratory progress, and integrates results with investigation findings. Laboratory confirmation supports investigation conclusions and enforcement decisions.

### Public Health Authority Interface
Integration with public health systems supports outbreak investigation, surveillance reporting, and community protection measures. National surveillance systems receive case notifications and investigation outcomes supporting broader disease monitoring and prevention programs.
