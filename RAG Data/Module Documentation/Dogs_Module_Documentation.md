## Complete Workflow

### Starting a Dog Control Case

#### Incident Notification and Initial Response
Dog control cases typically begin with public reports of stray dogs, dangerous behavior, animal welfare concerns, or bite incidents. Each case receives a unique dog ID for tracking throughout the process. Initial assessment determines urgency level and appropriate response including immediate collection, investigation requirements, or emergency public safety measures.

#### Location Assessment and Safety Evaluation
Incident locations are recorded with precise mapping coordinates supporting efficient officer deployment and public safety assessment. Environmental factors including proximity to schools, playgrounds, or busy roads influence response priority and safety measures. Location history may reveal patterns requiring targeted intervention or enhanced monitoring.

#### Contact and Owner Information Management
Comprehensive contact details are recorded for complainants, witnesses, and identified dog owners. Owner identification may involve microchip scanning, witness statements, or investigation of local connections. Contact management supports ongoing case communication and compliance monitoring throughout the process.

### Data Collection and Validation

#### Dog Identification and Description
Detailed dog characteristics include breed, size, color, age, sex, and distinctive markings supporting identification and owner location. Microchip scanning provides definitive identification where available. Photographic evidence supports case documentation and aids owner identification or adoption procedures.

#### Incident Details and Circumstances
Comprehensive incident recording includes date, time, circumstances, and behavior observations. Witness statements capture public safety concerns or animal welfare issues. Detailed descriptions support risk assessment and inform appropriate control measures or legal action requirements.

#### Health and Welfare Assessment
Dog health and welfare evaluation includes physical condition assessment, injury recording, and veterinary examination requirements. Vaccination status, neutering details, and health concerns influence housing arrangements and rehoming procedures. Welfare concerns may trigger investigation of owner care standards.

#### Legal and Compliance Information
Microchip compliance checking ensures adherence to identification requirements. Dog license verification where applicable confirms legal ownership status. Dangerous dog legislation assessment determines whether enhanced control measures or legal restrictions are required for public safety protection.

### Processing and Business Logic

#### Risk Assessment and Public Safety Evaluation
Case priority is determined by public safety risk including aggressive behavior, location factors, and previous incident history. Emergency procedures ensure immediate response to dangerous situations while routine cases follow standard collection and investigation procedures. Risk assessment informs housing requirements and handling procedures.

#### Owner Investigation and Contact Procedures
Owner identification involves multiple investigative approaches including microchip database searches, local inquiries, and witness statements. Contact procedures include formal notification of collection, legal requirements for reclaim periods, and compliance with statutory procedures for owner rights and responsibilities.

#### Case Management and Resource Allocation
Officer assignment considers expertise in animal handling, investigation skills, and geographic responsibilities. Resource planning ensures appropriate vehicle capacity, housing availability, and veterinary support. Complex cases may require specialist input including veterinary assessment or legal advice.

### Outcomes and Next Steps

#### Owner Reunion and Compliance Monitoring
Successful owner identification enables dog return following compliance verification and any required improvements. Microchip compliance may be enforced with formal requirements or penalties. Follow-up monitoring ensures sustained compliance and animal welfare standards are maintained.

#### Rehoming and Adoption Procedures
Unclaimed dogs undergo assessment for rehoming suitability including health checks, behavioral evaluation, and legal compliance verification. Adoption procedures ensure appropriate matching with new owners and ongoing welfare monitoring. Legal requirements for holding periods and rehoming procedures are carefully followed.

#### Enforcement Action and Legal Proceedings
Serious cases may require formal enforcement action including dangerous dog controls, prosecution for welfare offenses, or regulatory breach proceedings. Integration with notices and prosecution modules ensures coordinated legal response. Public safety measures may include destruction orders for dangerous animals.

#### Performance Monitoring and Service Development
Case statistics measure response times, successful reunions, and public satisfaction levels. Performance analysis identifies trends, resource requirements, and service improvement opportunities. Community education programs may be developed based on case patterns and prevention opportunities.

## Common Scenarios

### Stray Dog Collection and Owner Reunion
Public reports stray dog in residential area requiring collection and investigation. Dog warden responds, collects animal safely, and conducts microchip scan revealing owner details. Owner contacted and dog returned following compliance verification and any required improvements to containment or identification.

### Dangerous Dog Investigation and Control
Reports of aggressive dog behavior trigger investigation including witness interviews, risk assessment, and owner identification. Investigation confirms public safety risk requiring formal control measures including muzzling requirements, containment improvements, or legal restrictions under dangerous dog legislation.

### Dog Bite Incident Investigation
Serious bite incident requires immediate investigation including victim support, dog identification, and risk assessment. Investigation determines circumstances, owner responsibility, and appropriate control measures. Case may result in formal enforcement action, compensation claims, or destruction procedures for repeat offenders.

### Animal Welfare Investigation and Protection
