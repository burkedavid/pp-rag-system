## Complete Workflow

### Starting a Prosecution Case

#### Case Initiation and Legal Assessment
Prosecution cases typically arise from serious regulatory breaches identified through inspections, complaint investigations, or sample failures. Legal teams assess whether sufficient evidence exists for successful prosecution, considering factors like public interest, evidential sufficiency, and likelihood of conviction. Each case receives a unique prosecution number for tracking throughout the legal process.

#### Defendant Identification and Selection
The system allows prosecution of either business premises or individual defendants such as company directors or employees. For business prosecutions, the registered company details are automatically linked from premises records. Individual defendants require separate contact records with personal details including home addresses for legal service of documents.

#### Evidence Gathering and Case File Assembly
Prosecution cases must be linked to underlying evidence including inspection reports, sample results, witness statements, and photographs. The system connects prosecutions to related inspections, complaints, or enforcement actions to ensure complete case documentation. Legal teams compile evidence files ensuring proper chain of custody and admissibility for court proceedings.

### Data Collection and Validation

#### Core Prosecution Information
Every prosecution requires basic case details including the alleged offense date, responsible officer, regulatory area involved, and prosecution type. The system validates that all mandatory fields are completed before allowing case creation. Prosecution dates distinguish between when offenses occurred and when legal proceedings commenced.

#### Defendant and Legal Details  
Comprehensive defendant information includes personal or business details, legal representation, and contact information for court correspondence. The system maintains separate records for multiple defendants in complex cases involving corporate responsibility, director liability, or employee prosecutions.

#### Regulatory and Legislative Framework
Prosecutions must specify the exact regulations breached, section numbers, and applicable legislation. The system maintains databases of current regulations across all enforcement areas including food safety, health and safety, trading standards, and environmental protection. This ensures consistent charging and accurate legal references.

#### Court and Hearing Management
Court hearing dates, locations, and case references are tracked throughout the prosecution process. The system schedules hearings, records adjournments, and tracks case progress through various court stages. Plea information is recorded including guilty, not guilty, or no plea entries affecting case management and resource allocation.

### Processing and Business Logic

#### Case Validation and Quality Assurance
The system validates prosecution cases against legal requirements ensuring proper defendant identification, sufficient evidence linking, and correct regulatory citations. Quality checks prevent cases proceeding without adequate documentation and ensure compliance with prosecution policies and legal standards.

#### Resource and Cost Management
Prosecution costs are tracked including officer time, legal fees, expert witnesses, and court expenses. The system calculates total case costs and records any costs awarded by courts against defendants. This information supports budget management and cost recovery procedures for successful prosecutions.

Case progress is monitored through various stages from initial preparation to final outcome. The system tracks timescales, identifies delays, and provides management information about case loads and success rates. Performance indicators measure enforcement effectiveness and resource utilization.

### Outcomes and Next Steps

#### Court Hearing Results and Sentencing
The system records detailed hearing outcomes including guilty or not guilty verdicts, fines imposed, costs awarded, and any additional penalties such as community service or custody sentences. Victim surcharge amounts are tracked separately as required by court procedures and financial reporting.

#### Financial Outcomes and Cost Recovery
All financial aspects are recorded including fines imposed by courts, costs awarded to the prosecution authority, and victim surcharges. The system calculates net financial outcomes comparing prosecution costs against awards received. This information supports decision-making about future prosecution priorities and resource allocation.

#### Post-Conviction Monitoring and Compliance
Following successful prosecutions, the system may trigger enhanced monitoring of defendants through increased inspection frequencies or probationary periods. Failed prosecutions are analyzed to identify lessons learned and improve future case preparation. Appeals processes are tracked where defendants challenge convictions or sentences.

#### Performance Analysis and Strategic Planning
Prosecution outcomes are analyzed to identify trends, success rates, and effectiveness across different offense types and defendants. This information supports strategic planning about enforcement priorities, resource allocation, and training needs for investigation and legal teams.
