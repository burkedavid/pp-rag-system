Officers select appropriate notice types based on legal powers, severity of breaches, and enforcement policy guidance. The system ensures officers have appropriate authority and qualifications to serve specific notice types.

#### Legal Grounds Assessment and Evidence Review
Notice service requires sufficient evidence of regulatory breaches and appropriate legal justification. Officers review inspection reports, sample results, witness statements, and photographic evidence. Legal grounds are assessed against specific regulations and enforcement policies ensuring notices meet evidential standards for potential court proceedings.

#### Recipient Identification and Service Requirements
Notice recipients must be properly identified including business operators, property owners, or responsible individuals. The system captures complete contact details, business relationships, and service addresses. Legal service requirements vary by notice type including personal service, registered post, or site posting requirements.

### Data Collection and Validation

#### Notice Details and Legal References

Reference numbers link notices to underlying inspections, complaints, or enforcement cases. Legal citations reference specific regulations and statutory powers ensuring accurate legal foundation.

#### Compliance Requirements and Deadlines
Notices specify required actions, compliance deadlines, and standards to be achieved. The system calculates compliance periods based on notice types and regulatory requirements. Complex notices may include multiple requirements with different deadlines requiring careful project management and monitoring.
