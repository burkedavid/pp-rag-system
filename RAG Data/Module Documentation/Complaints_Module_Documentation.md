## Complete Workflow

### Starting a Complaint Investigation

#### How Complaints Are Received
The system accepts complaints through multiple channels. Members of the public can report issues by telephone, email, online forms, or by visiting council offices. Each complaint receives a unique reference number for tracking purposes. Officers can also create complaints based on their own observations during inspections or patrols.

#### Initial Complaint Registration
When a complaint is received, staff record basic details including the complainant's contact information, the nature of the problem, and the location where the issue occurred. The system asks for the date and time when the problem happened, how the complaint was received, and which officer took the initial report.

#### Complaint Classification and Routing
Each complaint must be assigned to the correct regulatory area such as food safety, noise control, environmental protection, or trading standards. The system automatically shows relevant fields based on the complaint type selected. For example, food complaints reveal additional fields for food business details, while fly tipping complaints show waste type and size options.

### Data Collection and Validation

#### Complainant Information Management
The system captures complete contact details for the person making the complaint. This includes their name, address, phone numbers, and email address. Staff can search existing contact records to avoid creating duplicates. The complainant's preferred contact method is recorded to ensure appropriate communication throughout the investigation.

#### Location and Premises Details
Every complaint must be linked to a specific location. Staff can search for registered business premises or create location records for private properties or public areas. The system uses mapping integration to ensure accurate geographic coordinates. For environmental complaints, additional location details like land type and proximity to sensitive areas are recorded.

#### Complaint Details and Evidence
Officers record detailed descriptions of the problem, including dates, times, and circumstances. The system supports file attachments for photographs, documents, and other evidence. For specific complaint types, additional specialized information is collected:

- Food complaints require details about illness symptoms and food consumed
- Noise complaints need timing patterns and duration information
- Fly tipping reports must specify waste types and quantities
- Trading standards complaints record product details and purchase information

#### Investigation Requirements
The system determines investigation priorities based on complaint type and severity. Response targets are automatically calculated according to regulatory requirements and council policies. Officers are assigned based on their expertise area and current workload. Urgent public health matters receive immediate priority routing.

### Processing and Business Logic

#### Complaint Validation and Quality Checks
The system validates complaint information to ensure all required fields are completed before allowing submission. It checks for duplicate complaints at the same location within recent timeframes. Automatic alerts notify supervisors when complaints involve high-risk situations or repeat locations requiring special attention.

#### Officer Assignment and Workload Management
Complaints are allocated to officers based on geographic areas, specialist expertise, and current caseloads. The system tracks officer availability and ensures fair distribution of workload. Supervisors can reassign cases when officers are unavailable or when specialist knowledge is required for complex investigations.

#### Investigation Planning and Resource Allocation
The system helps officers plan their investigation approach by displaying relevant premises history, previous complaints, and enforcement actions. It suggests potential inspection requirements and identifies if samples or other specialist activities may be needed. Resource requirements are flagged early to ensure proper planning and budgeting.

### Outcomes and Next Steps

#### Investigation Outcomes and Resolution
Officers record their investigation findings, including whether complaints are substantiated or unsubstantiated. The system tracks what actions were taken, such as informal advice, formal warnings, or enforcement notices. Resolution dates are recorded to measure performance against response targets.

#### Follow-up Actions and Monitoring
Substantiated complaints may trigger various follow-up activities. These can include formal inspections, sample collection, enforcement notices, or prosecution proceedings. The system links these activities back to the original complaint for complete case tracking. Officers can schedule follow-up visits to verify that problems have been resolved.

#### Complainant Communication and Feedback
The system tracks all communication with complainants throughout the investigation process. Standard letters can be generated at key stages to keep complainants informed of progress. Final outcome letters explain what action was taken and provide advice about future issues. Complainant satisfaction surveys may be sent to monitor service quality.

#### Performance Monitoring and Statistics
Investigation timescales are automatically calculated and monitored against target response times. Management reports show officer performance, complaint trends, and resolution rates. Statistical data is compiled for annual returns to government departments and for internal performance management purposes.

## Data Management

### Complaint Records and Documentation
The system maintains comprehensive records for every complaint including all correspondence, investigation notes, photographs, and related documents. Version control ensures that changes are tracked and previous versions remain accessible. Legal requirements for data retention are built into the system with automatic archiving and deletion schedules.

### Integration with Business and Contact Records
Complaints are linked to existing business premises records where applicable, providing immediate access to registration details, inspection history, and previous enforcement actions. Contact records for complainants are maintained separately to protect confidentiality while enabling efficient communication management.

### Geographic Information and Mapping
Location data is integrated with mapping systems to enable geographic analysis of complaint patterns. Hot spot identification helps target resources effectively and identify systemic problems requiring proactive intervention. Area-based reporting supports strategic planning and resource allocation decisions.

## Integration Points

### Connection with Premises and Business Records
When complaints involve registered businesses, the system automatically links to premises records showing licensing status, inspection history, and previous compliance issues. This provides investigators with comprehensive background information to inform their investigation approach and helps identify repeat offenders requiring enhanced enforcement action.

### Inspection and Enforcement Integration
Substantiated complaints often trigger follow-up inspections to verify compliance and assess broader regulatory adherence. The system automatically creates inspection records linked to the original complaint. If enforcement action is required, notices and legal proceedings are connected to provide complete case documentation for court purposes.

### Sample Collection and Laboratory Analysis
Food safety and environmental complaints may require sample collection for laboratory analysis. The system coordinates sample requests with testing laboratories and tracks results back to the original complaint. Positive results automatically trigger enforcement procedures and notification protocols for public health protection.

### External System Connections
The system interfaces with various external databases including business directories, mapping services, and government reporting systems. For noise complaints, integration with out-of-hours services ensures 24-hour response capability. Environmental complaints may connect to permit databases and pollution monitoring systems.
