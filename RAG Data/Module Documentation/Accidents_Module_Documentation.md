# Accidents Module

## Overview
The Accidents module manages the reporting, investigation, and follow-up of workplace and public accidents that fall under health and safety regulatory oversight. It handles RIDDOR (Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations) reporting requirements, investigation workflows, enforcement actions, and statistical monitoring to ensure compliance with health and safety legislation.

- **Enforcement integration**: Links to inspections, notices, and prosecution actions
- **Injured party tracking**: Contact management and injury categorization
- **Response tracking**: Investigation timelines and completion monitoring
- **Statistical reporting**: Performance indicators and trend analysis
- **Corporate and individual liability**: Tracking responsibility and legal implications
