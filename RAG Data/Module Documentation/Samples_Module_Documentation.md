# Samples Module

## Overview
The Samples module manages the collection, testing, and results tracking of samples taken for regulatory compliance across Food Safety, Trading Standards, Animal Health, and Environmental Protection. It handles both official enforcement samples and informal surveillance samples, integrating with laboratory analysis, enforcement actions, and statutory reporting requirements.

## Key Functionality
Based on analysis of the core class methods and template structures:

- **Multi-type sampling**: Food samples, consumer goods, animal feed, water quality samples
- **Official and informal samples**: Legal enforcement samples and routine surveillance
- **Laboratory integration**: Chain of custody and results management
- **Inspection linkage**: Samples taken during inspections and complaint investigations
- **Enforcement tracking**: Non-compliant results trigger enforcement actions
- **Product categorization**: Comprehensive product typing and classification
- **Results analysis**: Pass/fail determination and trend analysis
- **Statutory reporting**: Government returns and industry statistics
