# Inspections Module

## Overview
The Inspections module is the core compliance monitoring system that enables officers to conduct planned and reactive inspections across all regulatory domains. It manages the complete inspection lifecycle from scheduling through completion, including risk assessments, compliance scoring, and follow-up actions. The module integrates with premises registration, enforcement actions, and external reporting systems.

## Key Functionality
Based on analysis of the core object methods and template structures:

- **Multi-domain inspections**: Single inspection can cover multiple regulatory areas (Food Safety, Health & Safety, etc.)
- **Risk-based scheduling**: Automatic inspection frequency based on premise risk categories
- **Comprehensive assessments**: Risk scoring, FHRS ratings, HHSRS housing assessments
- **Activity tracking**: Detailed recording of inspection activities and outcomes
- **Officer assignment**: Work allocation and mobile inspection support
- **Quality assurance**: Review and validation workflows
- **Compliance monitoring**: Integration with enforcement actions and follow-up inspections
- **Statutory reporting**: Automatic generation of government returns and statistics

## Complete Workflow
