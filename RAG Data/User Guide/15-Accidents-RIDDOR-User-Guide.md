## FAQ

### Q: How do I determine if an accident is RIDDOR reportable?
**A**: Use the RIDDOR assessment scoring system. The system guides you through HSE criteria including fatalities, specified injuries, and dangerous occurrences.

### Q: What's the difference between Employee and Public accidents?
**A**: Employee accidents involve workplace injuries to employees/contractors. Public accidents involve members of the public. This affects available injury categories and RIDDOR assessment.

### Q: Can I modify a RIDDOR assessment after it's been approved?
**A**: No, once a RIDDOR assessment is signed by a line manager, the form becomes locked. You would need to delete and recreate if changes are essential.

### Q: How do I link an accident to a premises?
**A**: Use the premises search button when creating the accident record. You can search by name and select the appropriate premises from results.

### Q: What happens if the RIDDOR score is borderline for investigation?
**A**: Scores 15-19 are at officer discretion with manager discussion. Document your decision and reasoning in the "Reason for Deviation" field.
