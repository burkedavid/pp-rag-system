## FAQ

### Q: What's the difference between "Alleged" and "Group/Confirmed" cases?
**A**: "Alleged" is for individual suspected cases requiring investigation. "Group/Confirmed" is for confirmed outbreaks with multiple patients and identified infectious disease.

### Q: How do I link a case to multiple premises?
**A**: Use the premises search to link to the primary suspected premises. Additional premises can be noted in the remarks field or linked through related inspections.

### Q: Can I create a patient contact from the food poisoning form?
**A**: Yes, use the patient search button and select "Add" if the patient isn't found. This creates a new contact record directly.

### Q: How do I handle cases where the premises is ruled out?
**A**: Use the "Clear premises" option to unlink the premises if investigation rules it out as the source.

### Q: What should I do if a case becomes part of a larger outbreak?
**A**: Individual alleged cases can be linked to group cases through the group reference fields and coordination with the health protection team.
